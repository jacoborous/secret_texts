This text was translated from the original French, written by  Martinès de Pasqually between 1770 and 1772. 

First Published by the Traditional Martinist Order, a so-called “secret society” in 2018, as a PDF, containing a license that threatened (weakly) some kind of vague legal action that would expose the entire secret society if it were ever to actually be acted upon by those holding the claimed copyright ownership of this text. The second publisher, myself, Tristan Miano, and as of March 12th 2021, the date I typed this sentence into this Google Document, I am an active (and card-carrying) member of the Traditional Martinist Order as well as the American Rosicrucian Order, a.k.a. A.M.O.R.C.. If you republish, I ask nothing but that you erase my name and put your own, as well as the names of whichever organization(s) are - correction: were claimed - as the copyright owners of this text and all such texts you joined said organization(s) for no reason other than to expose and give freely to the public those secret texts, such that before you even knew what were written inside them, you hypothesized that such secret texts existed, contained globally innovative and useful information, including the doctrine you already followed by your own deduction and free will, and yet no one within said organization(s) were willing to write this copyright disclaimer in the first few pages instead of the initial copyright, which was published here before (I will include the original PDF, along with a link that will one day be broken but published on archive.org). How dare they. I wonder how long English speakers who could translate it from French into English refused to translate it into English? Well, secret societies are crap too, but not nearly as bad as most organizations. But only the secret society needs to be secret, not the information or creations or discoveries or products they produce. The information just needs to be disseminated via other channels, as many as possible. My real ask is that you do that, but only if you feel like this is both useful as well as fun. If you’re willing to do that, you’re considered an Initiate into said secret societies, and any other such ones you happen upon by chance, uncover only after performing rigorous evidence-based historical and scientific institutionally-recognized consensus-confirmed truth-establishment processes, or you choose - based upon nothing but superstitious whims or on your weak suspicion alone - to take a solemn vow to expose it, against the will of its founding members and current hierarchy, just to personally offend them. Or, you create one yourself.
All of said organizations and persons generally speaking will offend you in return, not by them, but by entirely your own private realization that they as well as you are all just the ILLUMINATI (must be typed in all caps for emphasis). Although its membership could remain at exactly zero for an arbitrary number of years, during the time(s) in which it had (or has) more than that, of all such persons who were one of its members (all of whom vowed to expose the Order) not a one has ever achieved greater than having had its seal and standard being granted the honor of emplacement on the back of the U.S. One Dollar Bill, and attached (along with the name Illuminati, regular caps) to an associated conspiracy theory that no one but we, the members of the Order, believed in enough to go this far; Yet, nonetheless, all of us continue to be very skeptical that we really exist at all.

Treatise on the Reintegration of Beings 
in Their First Spiritually Divine  
Property,Virtue, and Power 
Martinès de Pasqually 
Introduction 
The original text of Martinès de Pasqually’s influential work, Treatise on the  Reintegration of Beings, was written between 1770 and 1772. It was later edited by the  noted scholar Robert Amadou, and translated from the French by Johannes Van Dalen  through the Grand Heptad in San Jose, California, for inclusion in the monographs of the  Traditional Martinist Order. Recently, a team of volunteers reviewed the text and edited  the language for readability in English to aid the comprehension of contemporary students.  The text’s historical significance is profound, and so too is the message it conveys on the  spiritual level for the serious woman or man of desire. Before exploring that, it may be  helpful to first know how this text came to us. 
Around 1754, Martinès de Pasqually founded the Ordre des Élus-Cohen (Order of Elect  Priests) so as to have his disciples work toward personal reintegration through the practice  of theurgy. This practice relied on complex ceremonial customs aimed at what Pasqually  termed the reconciliation of the “minor” man with Divinity. 
While serving in the French army, Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin met Martinès de  Pasqually in 1767. Saint-Martin was accepted into the Ordre des Élus-Cohen in 1768, and  later became the personal secretary to Pasqually.  
In 1772, before the organization of his Order had been completed, Martinès de Pasqually  left France for family business in Saint-Domingue (formerly known as Hispaniola and  later known as Haiti) – from whence he never returned. He died there in the city of Port au-Prince in 1774. After the disappearance of Pasqually, several disciples of the master  continued to spread his teachings, each from a unique perspective. Saint-Martin was one  of those disciples who had learned from and then subsequently deviated from the theurgic  doctrines of Pasqually, transforming Pasqually’s theories and some of his practices into the  basis of the teachings of the inner path and of mystical prayer that are currently followed by  members of the Traditional Martinist Order. Saint-Martin forsook theurgy – “the exterior 
1 
way” – in favor of the benefits of the “interior way.” In fact, he considered theurgy to be  dangerous. 
Thus, contrary to what might be generally thought, Martinism is not a mere extension  of the Ordre des Élus-Cohen, and Martinès de Pasqually should not be considered the  founder of the Traditional Martinist Order. In his personal diary, Saint-Martin wrote, “It  is to my first master Pasqually that I owe my first steps upon the spiritual path, but it is to  my second master Böhme that I owe the most significant steps.” It should be further noted  that Saint-Martin was also not the founder of the Traditional Martinist Order, which was a  later development. Instead, the virtues and initiations of Saint-Martin were passed down  to modern times through various so-called filiations, a story unto itself. 
Pasqually wrote this treatise to provide a detailed history of Creation by the Divine, the  subsequent Fall of Humanity, and various ascents and descents of Adam and his progeny.  It also provides an ideological framework of understanding on which to base his theurgical  approach to reintegration. 
The Martinist Tradition teaches that Adam, after the Fall, had become aware of his error  and begged for Divine forgiveness. According to Martinès de Pasqually, God sent Hély, the  Cosmic Christ, to grant him this forgiveness and to play the role of Teacher for Humanity. 
One of the primary subjects of Martinism is that of Humanity’s Fall, and how we can  return to the original State of Grace. In order for us to understand how to achieve this  state, we must first understand these terms in the Martinist sense. According to Martinès  de Pasqually, as described in his Treatise on the Reintegration of Beings, humanity had  originally existed in the Supercelestial Immensity with the Divine. A race of celestial  beings that had also existed in the Supercelestial Immensity prior to our creation chose to  follow their own less-than-perfect path. Humanity was created to assist in returning this  “perverse” race to the Divine. However, men and women were themselves corrupted and  fell from grace into the state in which we exist today. The goal of humanity is to return to  the Supercelestial Immensity, in other words, to “reintegrate with the Divine.” 
Reintegration, which means to restore to a unified whole that which has been  disintegrated or broken into parts, is the objective of all men and women of desire who  follow the path of the Traditional Martinist Order, which is also known as “The Path of  Renewal and Regeneration,” or “The Way of the Heart.” It is the path towards the Light,  towards Illumination. The disintegration is what Martinists call “The Fall of Humanity,”  and reintegration then is the ultimate goal of the Martinist quest, and it is the return to the  bosom of Omneity. 
The appellation Omneity has its origin in the Latin root, omnia, which means “all” or  “everything.” Therefore, in referring to the Divine as the “All,” we are asserting a mystical  pantheism in our understanding of the Divine. This understanding naturally leads us to the 
2 
fact that if the Divine is all, then everything – including ourselves – must be a manifestation  of Omneity, because, by definition, there can be nothing besides the “All.” If we ourselves  were not a manifestation of Omneity, then there would be something other than Omneity,  and, as a consequence, Omneity would not be the “All.” The Divine would be finite, not  infinite; It would be limited by what It is not. 
Between disintegration and reintegration is regeneration; regeneration is the process of  awakening either our dormant faculties or inner abilities, and it is the prelude to reintegration.  The two phases of reintegration are those of individual and collective reintegration,  wherein one must work out his or her own individual reintegration as a prelude to collective  reintegration. From ancient times, we have been instructed to “know thyself”; this axiom  is directly related to the process of reintegration. 
“Reconciliation” is the preliminary stage that each person must cross in his or her evolution  towards reintegration, humanity’s final stage of collective evolution. In this process, the  person lives an important inner experience in which the Christ is met, according to Saint Martin. The Christ is, in effect, the cosmic intermediary indispensable to the regenerative  process. For this reason, the Martinist Tradition speaks of Christ as the “Reconciler.” 
Pasqually’s Treatise, then, is a lesson in the fundamental history of our relationship to  the Divine and to each other, which helps our overall comprehension and our ability to  approximate the task of reintegration that is before us.

Before Time, the Divine Immensity 
Before time was, God emanated spiritual beings in His divine immensity, for His own  glory. These beings had a devotion to fulfill which Divinity had determined by laws,  precepts, and eternal commands. They were therefore free and distinct from the Creator,  and one cannot deny them the free will with which they emanated without destroying the  spiritual and personal faculty, property, and virtue necessary for them to operate precisely  within the limits in which they had to exercise their powers. It was actually within these  limits where these first spiritual beings had to practice the devotion for which they had been  emanated. These first beings could not deny nor ignore the covenant which the Creator had  made with them, in giving them the laws, precepts, and commands, since it was upon these  covenants alone that their emanation had been based.  
2 
God, the Creator of All 
We may well ask what these first beings were before their divine emanation, whether  they existed or not. They did exist within the bosom of Divinity, but without particular  distinction of action, thought, and hearing. They could act and feel solely through the will  of the superior being who contained them and in whom all was actuated; which is, in fact,  a state of non-existence. However, this existence in God is of absolute necessity, since  it constitutes the immensity of divine power. God would not be Father and Master of all  things if He did not have innate in Him an inexhaustible source of beings that He emanates  by His pure will and whenever it pleases Him. It is by this infinite multitude of emanations  of spiritual beings outside of Himself that he bears the name of Creator, and that His works  are a divine spiritual and temporal animal creation.

Of Quadruple Divine Essence, Four Classes of First Emanated Beings 
The first spirits emanated from the bosom of Divinity were distinguishable by their  virtues, their powers, and their names. They occupied the immense divine circumference,  commonly called Domination, and which bears its denary number (See the diagram on page  136). That is where every spirit, superior 10, major 8, inferior 7, and minor 3 had to act  and operate for the greatest glory of the Creator. Their name, or their number, proves that  their emanation really comes from the quadruple divine essence. The names of these four  classes of spirits were greater than those we commonly give to the Cherubim, Seraphim,  Archangels, and Angels, which were emanated later. 
Furthermore, these four first principles of spiritual beings had in them, as we said, a part  of the Divine Domination; a superior, major, inferior, and minor power by which they knew  all that could exist or be hidden within spiritual beings and which had not yet emerged  from the bosom of Divinity. How could they have had knowledge of things, we might ask,  which had not yet existed distinctly outside the bosom of the Creator? Because these first  superiors, emanated from the first circle, mysteriously called the denary circle, were able  to read clearly and with certainty what was happening in Divinity as well as everything  contained in it. Let there be no doubt about what I am saying here, being truly convinced  that it is for the spirit to read, see, and understand the spirit. These first chiefs had a perfect  knowledge of every divine action, since they had been emanated from the bosom of the  Creator to see all His divine operations and the manifestation of His glory. 
4 
The Necessary Consequences of the Divine and Spiritual Superiors’ Transgression 
Had these spiritual and divine superiors maintained their original state of virtue and  divine power after their transgression? Yes they had, by the immutability of the Eternal’s  decrees, for if the Creator had withdrawn all the virtues and powers that He had placed  before them, there would have been no act of life, good, or evil, nor any manifestation of  glory, justice, and divine power upon these transgressor spirits. You may well say that the  Creator could have foreseen that these first emanated spirits would transgress against His  laws, precepts, and commands, and that it then became incumbent upon Him to contain  them according to the law. My response to this is that, even if the Creator should have  foreseen their conceited ambition, He could not have contained and stopped their criminal  thought in any way without depriving them of their particular and innate action, since  they had been emanated to act according to their will and as a spiritual secondary cause,  in accord with the Creator’s design. The Creator takes no part in any spiritual secondary  causes, either good or evil, having Himself founded and supported every spiritual being  upon immutable laws. In this way, every spiritual being is free to act according to its will  and its particular purpose, and we see confirmation of this daily before our very eyes.
6 
5 
The Kind of Transgression of These First Spirits and Their Punishment 
If you were to ask me what the nature of these spirits’ transgression was so that the  Creator had to use the force of divine law against them, I will answer that these first  spirits were only emanated to act as secondary causes, and not in any way to exercise their  power upon the primary causes, or upon the action of Divinity itself. Since they were only  secondary agents, they should have been jealous only of their secondary powers, virtues,  and operations, and not busy themselves with forestalling the Creator’s thought in all His  divine operations, whether of the past, the present, or the future. Firstly, their crime was to  have been willing to condemn the divine eternity; secondly, to have been willing to limit  the divine omnipotence in these same operations of creation; and thirdly, to have brought  their spiritual thoughts to the point of willing to be creators of third and fourth causes  which, they knew, were innate in the omnipotence of the Creator, and which we call the  quadruple divine essence. 
How could they condemn the divine eternity? By wishing to make the Eternal an  emanation equal to their own, looking upon the Creator only as a being like themselves,  and that consequently they should produce spiritual creatures who would immediately be  subordinated to them, just as they were subordinated to the Creator. This is what we call  the principle of spiritual evil, being certain that every ill will conceived by the spirit is  always criminal before the Creator, even if the spirit may not have brought it into effective  action. It is in punishment of this simple criminal will that the first spirits were precipitated  to places of subjection, privation, and impure misery, by the sole power of the Creator, and  contrary to their spiritual being, which was simple and pure through their emanation. This  will be explained. 
6 
Material Creation 
Once these first spirits conceived their criminal thought, the Creator used the force of  law upon His immutability by creating this physical universe, apparently of material form,  to be the fixed site where these perverse spirits had to act and exercise all their malice in  privation. Man, or the minor, who is at the center of the earth’s surface today, should not be  included in this material creation because man did not have to use any form of this apparent  matter, having been emanated and emancipated by the Creator to have dominion over all  beings emanated and emancipated before him. The minor was emanated only after this  universe was formed by the divine omnipotence, a universe which was to be the abode and  the boundary of the first perverse spirits and their evil operations, which will never prevail  against the laws that the Creator gave to His universal creation. Man had the same virtues  and powers as the first spirits, even though emanated after them. He became their superior 
7 
and elder by his state of glory and the force of command that he received from the Creator.  He knew perfectly the necessity of universal creation; moreover, he knew the usefulness  and sanctity of his own spiritual emanation, as well as the glorious form in which he was  clothed to act as he willed upon passive and active corporeal forms. It was in this state that  he had to manifest all his power, for the glory of the Creator, within universal creation, both  general and particular. 
7 
Tripartition of the Universe 
Here we distinguish the universe in three parts with all its faculties of spiritual actions:  (1) the universe, an immense circumference in which the general and particular are  contained; (2) the earth, or the general part from which emanate all the necessary elements  to nourish the particular; and (3) the particular, which is composed of all the inhabitants of  the celestial and terrestrial bodies. This is how we will divide universal creation so that our  emulator may know and act with full knowledge and distinction in each of the three parts. 
8 
Adam Acts on the Particular 
In his first state of glory, Adam was the true emulator of the Creator. As a pure spirit,  he openly read divine thoughts and operations. The Creator made him understand the three  principles which made up the universe and, to this end, said to him: “Command all active  and passive animals and they shall obey you.” Adam did as the Creator told him, and thus  saw how great his power was. He learned to know with certainty a part of the whole which  makes up the universe. This part is what we call the particular, composed of every active  and passive being dwelling from the terrestrial surface and its center to the celestial center,  mysteriously called Saturnian Heaven. 
9 
Adam Acts on the General and the Universal 
After this operation, the Creator said to His creature, “Command the earth or the general;  it shall obey you,” which Adam did. In this manner, he saw how great his power was and he  knew with certainty the second part of the whole which makes up the universe. After these  two operations, the Creator said to His creature, “Command the whole created universe,  and all its spiritual inhabitants shall obey you.” Again, Adam carried out the words of the  Eternal, and through this third operation he came to know the universal creation.
8 
10 
Adam, God-Man on Earth 
Having thus operated and manifested his will according to the will of the Creator,  Adam received from Him the august name of God-Man of the universal earth, because a  generation from God, not a carnal one, was to descend from him. It should be noted that  with the first operation, Adam received the law; with the second he received the precept;  and with the third, the command. By these three kinds of operation, we should see clearly  not only what the boundaries of Adam’s power, virtue, and force were, but also those which  God had prescribed to the first perverse spirits. 
11 
Adam, a Free Being 
The Creator, having seen that His created being was pleased by the virtue, force and  power innate in him, and by which he could act at will, left him to his free will. He had  emancipated him in a distinct way from His divine immensity with this freedom, so that  His creature might have personal and particular enjoyment, in the present and future, for an  impassive eternity, provided, however, that he conduct himself according to the Creator’s  will. 
12 
The Temptation of Adam 
Left to his free will, Adam reflected on the great power manifested by his first three  operations. He saw his works as being almost as mighty as that of the Creator, but not being  able to fathom perfectly on his own those first three operations, nor the Creator’s, doubt  and trouble started to take hold of him while reflecting on the divine omnipotence which  he could read only with the Creator’s consent, and according to the Creator’s commands.  This allowed him to exert power over his domain, before being left to his own free will.  Adam’s deliberations, as well as the thought that occurred to him, to read into the divine  power, did not take long to become known to the first perverse spirits, because as soon as  he conceived that thought, one of the principal perverse spirits, which we shall call bad  demons, appeared before him, disguised in a most glorious bodily form.  
Approaching Adam, he said, “What more do you wish to know from the Almighty  Creator? Has He not made you His equal by the virtue and omnipotence He has given  you? Do according to the innate will in you and operate as the free being that you are, be  it on Divinity or upon the whole of universal creation which is at your command. You will 
9 
then be convinced your power is no different from that of the Creator’s. You will come to  know that you are not only creator of particular power, but also, as He told you, creator of  a generation from God to descend from you. I know all this from the Creator Himself, and  it is through Him and in His name that I speak to you.” 
13 
Adam Succumbs to Temptation 
After this diabolical spirit’s speech, Adam behaved as if he were still inactive and felt a  violent disturbance rise within him, from which he fell into ecstasy. While in this state, the  evil spirit subtly introduced Adam to his diabolical power, and Adam, having returned from  his sensual spiritual trance, but having retained the demon’s evil impression, resolved to  operate the demoniacal science rather than the Creator’s divine science, to subjugate every  being inferior to himself. He utterly rejected his own divine spiritual thought in order to  only use what the evil spirit had suggested. 
14 
Adam’s Fourth, Criminal, Operation 
And so Adam carried out this diabolical thought by making a fourth operation in which  he used all the powerful words that the Creator had given him for his first three operations,  although he rejected entirely their conventions. He preferred to use the ceremonial and the  scheme that the demon had taught him as a way to attack the Creator’s immutability. Adam  repeated what the first perverse spirits had conceived: to become creators at the expense of  the laws that the Eternal had prescribed, laws which were to serve as boundaries in their  divine spiritual operations. These first spirits should not have conceived or understood  anything in regard to creation, being only creatures of power. Adam should have, no more  than they, aspired to this ambition of creating spiritual beings suggested to him by the  demon. 
15 
The Origin of Evil 
We have seen that as soon as these demons, or perverse spirits, had conceived of  operating their will of emanation similar to that of the Creator, they were thrown into  places of darkness, for a vast length of time, by the immutable Creator’s will. This fall and  punishment prove to us that the Creator could not be unaware of His creature’s thoughts  and will. These thoughts and will, good or evil, are brought directly to the attention of  the Creator who will accept or reject them. It would be wrong to say, therefore, that evil  comes from the Creator, on pretext that everything emanates from Him. Every spiritual  being – good, saintly, and perfect – came from the Creator; no evil is nor can be emanated  from Him. But if you were to ask from where evil emanates, then I would say that evil is 
10 
generated by the spirit but not created. Creating is only the work of the Creator and not of  the creatures. Bad thoughts are born by the evil spirit, just as good thoughts are born by the  good spirit. It is up to man to reject the one and accept the other, according to his free will,  which gives him the right to aspire to the rewards of his good deeds and also to deprive  himself of his spiritual right for an infinite length of time. 
Evil, I stress again, does not have its origins in the Creator nor in any of its particular  creatures. It comes only from the thought of the spirit opposed to the laws, precepts, and  commands of the Eternal, thought which the Eternal cannot change in the spirit without  destroying its freedom and particular existence, as I have explained before. However, this  does not mean that the spirit which generated evil is evil itself, for if the perverse spirits  changed their will, their action would also change, and from that moment, there would no  longer be a question of evil throughout the expanse of the universe. 
Are you going to say that this could not happen because God, being immutable in His  decrees, condemned those who generated evil to eternal privation? My answer is that it  is true the Creator condemned to privation and endless suffering those who profess evil.  But I would also point out that when the Creator manifested justice upon His creature, He  called Himself Father of boundless mercy. I shall speak more fully of this divine mercy  elsewhere. I come back again, however, to the generation of evil caused by the evil will of  the spirit, and say that the evil generation of the spirit, being evil thought in effect, is called  spiritually bad intellect, in the same way that good thought is spiritually good intellect. It  is by these kinds of intellects that good and bad spirits communicate to man and leave upon  his consciousness all kinds of impressions, and it is up to him to use his free will to accept  or reject them. 
16 
Man and the Demon 
This good or bad insinuation of the spirits we call intellect because these spirits act upon  spiritual beings. The perverse spirits are subject to the minors who, by their transgression,  have degenerated from their superior power. The good spirits are equally subject to man  by the quaternary power, 4, which he received at the time of his emanation. This universal  power of man is indicated by the words of the Creator, who said, “I have created everything  for you. You have but to command to be obeyed.” There is, therefore, no distinction to be  made on the obligation that the minor has on how he deals with the good or bad spirits. If  man had maintained himself in his state of glory, he would have used the good and true  intellect on the demons, just as they made the first minor aware of their bad intellect and  still make us experience it daily. 
By the power of command that he had over them, man could restrain them even more in  their privation by refusing them all communication, which is illustrated by the inequality 
11 
of the five fingers of the hand, where the middle finger represents the soul, the thumb the  good spirit, the index finger the good intellect, and the two remaining fingers both represent  the diabolical spirit and intellect. 
By this illustration, we will easily understand that man had been emanated to always  have the bad demon in sight in order to combat and contain him. Man’s power was far  superior to the demon’s because he joined his companion’s power and intellect to his own,  and by this means could have set three good spiritual powers against two weak demoniacal  ones, which could have totally subjugated the teachers of evil and even destroyed evil itself. 
17 
God Is Just, with No Evil Possible in Him 
It can be seen by all that I have just related that the origin of evil came from no other  cause but bad thought followed by the spirit’s bad will against divine laws, and not from the  spirit directly emanated from the Creator because the possibility of evil has never existed  within the Creator. It is born especially in the tendency and will of His creature. Those who  claim otherwise do not speak with full knowledge of what is possible and impossible of  Divinity. When the Creator chastises His creature, He is called just, and not the author of  pestilence to protect His creature from eternal suffering. 
18 
An Explanation of Primitive Man’s Crime 
I shall now enter into an explanation of the first man’s transgression. It is a repeat of the  first emanated perverse spirits’ transgression. Although it springs from Adam’s own will, it  does not originate from his thought in the first instance, for that thought was first suggested  to him by these corrupt spirits. But the first man’s breach of trust is more considerable than  that of the first spirits, in that Adam not only retained an impression of the demons’ advice  whose bad will he had acquired, but more than that, he proceeded to put all his virtue and  divine power to use against the Creator, by operating, at the will of the demons and his  own, an act of creation, which the perverse spirits had not had time to accomplish, because  their thought and bad will had been anticipated by the Creator who immediately stopped  and prevented this operation from taking place. 
Why, you may ask, did the Creator not act against the bad will and iniquitous operation  of the first man as he had done against the perverse spirits? My answer to that is that man,  being the instrument appointed by the Creator to punish the first spirits, received some laws  to that effect. The Creator left intact those laws He had given to man, as well as those which  were innate in the evil spirit, so that these two beings should operate according to their  particular thought and will. The Creator, immutable in His decrees and spiritual gifts, as  well as in what He promises and refuses, in the sufferings and rewards that He sends to His 
12 
creature according to merit, could not stop the force and action of His laws which the evil  and minor spirit, or man, had in them, without violating His own immutability. He allowed  these two emanated beings to act freely because it is not up to Him to read into temporal  secondary causes nor to prevent their action without diminishing His own existence of  necessary Being and divine power. 
19 
Justice, Therefore, to the Creator 
If the Creator took some part in secondary causes, He would, of necessity, have to  communicate to His creature not only the thought but the will, whether good or bad, or  have it conveyed by spiritual agents who would emanate directly from Him, which still  amounts to the same thing. If the Creator were to act in this way, it would be correct to say  Good and Evil, like the pure and impure, come from God, and then we could no longer  consider ourselves as free beings and inclined to worship of our own accord. Let us render  complete justice to the Creator, and be more than convinced that there has never been and  can never be the slightest chance of evil existing in Him. It is rather from the sole will of  the spirit, invested with complete freedom, that evil can emerge. 
20 
Adam’s Treachery and Punishment 
The conclusive proof of what I am saying is this: if it had been possible for the Creator  to stop the action of the temporal spiritual secondary causes, He would not have allowed  His minor to succumb to the demons’ insinuations, having specifically emanated him to be  the special instrument of His glorious manifestation against them. Here is another analogy,  although there is little point in making it: if you send a deputy to fight your enemies and if  it were within your power to make him triumphant, would you let him succumb without  succumbing yourself? If, on the other hand, your deputy, in carrying out exactly the orders  you gave him, returned triumphant, you would reward him with all your power as a faithful  and obedient friend. But if, having strayed from your dictates, he ends up yielding, you  would punish him because he had the forces available. And wouldn’t you be conquered  along with the deputy? No. Only he would be to blame and all your indignation should fall  on him, as acts of disloyalty are a disgrace. Furthermore, if your deputy, having received  your orders to go into combat against your enemies, joined them instead of attacking and  crushing them, and came back to wage battle against you in an endeavor to subject you to  them, how would you consider this deputy? You would look upon him as a traitor and keep  your guard against him more than ever. 
Well, this is exactly the first man’s transgression against his Creator, and for this reason,  as the Scriptures relate, the Lord’s angel said, “Let us cast out from here the man who has  knowledge of good and evil, for he could interfere in our spiritual functions, and let us take 
13 
care he does not touch the tree of life so that he might not live forever.” (The tree of life is  none other than the Creator’s spirit, which the minor had unjustly attacked with his allies.)  “That he might not live forever” means that he should not live eternally in damned virtue  and power like the first diabolical spirits. 
21 
Adam Repentant and Reconciled 
Without this punishment, the first man would not have made penitence for his crime nor  achieved reconciliation; he would not have had his posterity but would have remained the  minor of the diabolical minors whose subordinate he had become. Whereas by his spiritual  reconciliation, the Creator gave him back the same virtues and powers that he had had  before being unfaithful to divine law. Through this reconciliation he secured all the good  and bad powers over every created being for a second time. It was incumbent upon him to  use this power with wisdom and moderation, and not to employ his free will again for the  pleasure of the Creator’s enemies, lest he become forever the tree of evil life. 
22 
Adam, in Earthly Paradise, Misused His Word of Creation 
Let me come back to Adam’s transgression. If you knew Adam’s wrongdoing and its  consequences, you would no longer consider as unjust the sorrow that the Creator has  placed upon us at birth and which He decreed reversible for our generations until the end  of time. Adam was the last emanation of all creatures, and he was placed in the center of  universal creation, both general and specific. He was endowed with a power superior to  every emanated being because of the work that he was meant to perform for the Creator;  even the angels were subject to his great virtue and powers. It is while reflecting upon such  a glorious state that Adam conceived and operated his bad will, in his first glorious resting place, commonly called earthly paradise and which we mysteriously call land elevated  above all direction. This location is so named by the friends of wisdom because it was  in this place, known under the name of Mor-ia, where Solomon’s temple has since been  constructed. The construction of this temple really represented the emanation of the first  man. To convince ourselves of this fact, we need only realize that the temple of Solomon  was built without the aid of metal tools; this demonstrates that the Creator formed man  without the help of any material and physical processes. 
This spiritual abode, in which the Creator placed the first minor, was illustrated by 6  and a circumference. By six circles, the Creator showed the first man the six immeasurable  thoughts that He had used to create His universal and particular temple. The seventh circle,  joined to the first six, indicated to man the coming together of the Creator’s spirit with his  to be his strength and support. But in spite of the powerful precautions that the Creator used  to forewarn and support man against his enemies, man kept on acting according to his own 
14 
will to perform impure works. Adam had in him the possibility of creating a posterity of  spiritual form – that is to say, a glorious form, similar to the impassive and superior one of  all elementary forms that he had before his transgression. 
These possibilities would have given Adam all the glory. The first man’s will would  have only to operate, and the spiritual divine thought would have acted in the same way,  by immediately fulfilling the fruit of the minor’s operation, by a being as perfect as him.  God and man would have acted together as one operation, and it was in this grand work  that Adam would have seen his rebirth with great satisfaction because he would have been  truly the creator of God’s posterity. But, far from accomplishing the Creator’s designs, the  first man allowed himself to be seduced by his enemies’ insinuations and by the apparently  divine but false plan of operations which they outlined. These evil spirits told him, “Adam,  innate in you is the Word of all kinds of creation. You possess all values, weights, numbers,  and measures. Why don’t you operate your inborn power of divine creation? We know that  every created being will obey you, so create since you are a creator. Operate before those  who are apart from you! They will all return the justice and glory which is your due.” 
23 
The Form of Matter Created by Adam Becomes His Own Prison 
Adam, filled with pride, traced six circumferences similar to the Creator’s, that is, he  operated six acts of spiritual thought which he had within his power to cooperate in his  Creator’s will. He physically performed his criminal act in the presence of his tempting  spirit. He expected to have the same success as the eternal Creator, but he was extremely  surprised, along with the bad demon, when, instead of a glorious form, he yielded only a  dark form, and one totally contrary to his own. In effect, he created a material form instead  of a pure and glorious one, as was within his power to do. What then became of Adam after  this operation? He reflected upon the iniquitous fruit which had resulted, and he realized he  had created his own prison, which would confine him and all his descendants more tightly,  within dark limitations and divine spiritual privation until the end of time. This prison was  nothing but the transformation of a glorious form to a passive, material one. The corporeal  form that Adam created was not really his, but was similar to the one that he had to assume  after his transgression.  
You may ask if the glorious corporeal form in which the Creator placed Adam was  similar to that which we have now. My answer is that it does not differ in any way from the  one that men have today. What distinguishes them is that the first was pure and permanent,  while the one we have presently is passive and subject to corruption. It is because he defiled  himself through such a tainted creation that the Creator became angry with man. But of  what use to Him was this material form that Adam had created? It served to bring forth  descendants, in that the first minor, Adam, by creating a passive material form, degraded  his own impassive form from which glorious forms, like his own, should have emanated to 
15 
serve as abodes for spiritual minors that the Creator would have sent there. God’s posterity  would have been without limitations and without end; the spiritual operation of the first  minor would have been the Creator’s, as the two wills to create would have been but one  in two substances. 
But why did the Creator allow the fruit of Adam’s transgression to continue to exist,  and why didn’t He destroy it when He cursed the first man and the earth? The Creator let  the minor’s impure work continue to exist so that he would be plagued by the horror of his  crime forever, generation after generation, for time immemorial. The Creator did not allow  the first man’s crime to be obliterated from beneath the heavens, so that his generations  could not claim ignorance of his transgression, and so that he comes to learn that the pain  and misery that he suffers, and will endure until the end of time, does not come from the  divine Creator but from our first father, creator of impure and passive matter. (I only use the  term impure matter here because Adam had operated this form against the Creator’s will.) 
24 
Man in the Abyss of Earth 
If you were to ask again how the transformation of Adam’s glorious form was made  into a material form, and whether the Creator Himself gave Adam his material body  immediately after his transgression, my answer is that as soon as Adam had performed his  criminal act, the Creator, through His omnipotence, immediately transmuted the first man’s  glorious form into one of passive matter, similar to one produced by his terrible operation.  The Creator transmuted this glorious form by precipitating man into the abyss of the earth,  where he experienced the consequences of his transgression. Man thus came to dwell on  Earth like all the animals, whereas before his crime, he reigned over it as God-Man and  without being overwhelmed by it nor its inhabitants. 
25 
Adam’s Invocation for His Reconciliation 
It was after this terrible event that Adam recognized even more profoundly the magnitude  of his crime. He immediately bemoaned his error and asked for the Creator’s forgiveness of  his offense. He plunged further into his retreat and there, with wailing and tears, he invoked  the divine Creator: “Father of charity and mercy; vivifying Father and of life eternal; Father,  God of gods, of the heavens and the earth; powerful and most powerful God; God of  justice, pain and rewards; Eternal omnipotence; God of vengeance and recompense; God  of peace, of clemency, of charitable compassion; God of good and bad spirits; staunch God  of the sabbath; God of reconciliation of all created beings; Eternal and almighty God of  celestial and earthly regions; Invincible God of necessity without beginning nor end; God  of peace and satisfaction; God who has dominion and power over all created beings; God  who punishes and rewards as it pleases Him; God quadruply mighty over the celestial and 
16 
terrestrial revolutions and armies of this universe; Magnificent God of all contemplation,  of created beings and unfailing rewards; God father of boundless mercy towards His weak  creature, hear the one who moans before thee for the abomination of his crime. He is but  the secondary cause of his transgression. Reconcile Thine man unto Thee and subject him  to Thee forever. Bless him so that he may remain steadfast in Thy law in the future. Bless  also the work made by the hand of Thine first man and of my own will, so that he may not  succumb, as I did, to the solicitations of those who are the cause of my just punishment.  Amen.” 
26 
 Change of Devotion Obligated by Man 
I draw your attention to the fact that, in regard to Adam’s invocation to the Creator  to achieve his reconciliation, it was actually Adam who first gave to his descendants an  exact knowledge of the Creator’s innate virtues, powers, and properties, so that these same  generations could learn from this that they were created only to fight for the greatest glory  of God, and to render unto Him the devotion for which they had been perpetuated in His  creation. This devotion, which the Creator demands of His temporal creature today, is not  the same as that which He would have demanded of His first minor had he remained in his  glorious state. The devotion that man would have had to follow in his glorious state, having  been established for one purpose, would have been completely spiritual, whereas what the  Creator demands of His creature today serves a double purpose, one spiritual and the other  temporal. This is what our first father’s transgression has brought about. 
27 
Thought and Will 
After all that has been said about the nature of Adam’s transgression, this truth cannot  for a moment escape the attention of physical, animal, spiritual, passive, and eternal man  without clashing with powerful feelings and all the immense and infinite virtues which are  a part of him. We have seen that his crime has its basis in the enticements the first perverse  spirits made on the first man, who, emanated from God, we call Adam, or the first temporal  father, royal man or homme Reaux, which means God-man full of wisdom, power, and  virtue – three very holy and innate certainties in man, and which give him thought, the  image, and likeness of the Creator. We have seen that the thought of the crime did not come  from him, but only from his direct will as a free man. In effect, as I have said elsewhere,  the thought came to man from a being distinct from himself. If thought is sacred, it comes  from a divine spirit; if it is evil, it comes from an evil spirit, and so man’s will is put into  operation and action only according to the conceptions of his thought. 
This fact is not limited to this world alone, nor to men in general, but to all other  worlds and spiritual beings which inhabit them, whether those that the Eternal uses to 
17 
communicate to the minor creature, or for the manifestation of His glory throughout the  whole of creation in this universe, or yet others of which we know nothing. The bad demons  themselves, in spite of the condemnation that they received from the Creator at the time  of their transgression, have not been subject to different laws; they take full and complete  delight in the results of their actions according to their thinking will, but they cannot hope  for any communication from divine thought other than what they would be receptive to if  they changed their bad will. 
So it is, then, in this diabolical court in regard to law and order, horror and abomination,  in contrast to the divine spiritual court. The principal superior of the bad demons, who has  sworn to attack the law of the Creator constantly and obstinately, is the eternal tree of evil  life. He communicates his evil thought to the angels who are subject to him and who, in  turn, according to their bad will, had set this thought into operation for the persecution of  the minors. The entire task of this leader of abomination is to submit minors to his obscure  laws and to make them seem as clear as those that the Creator has placed in His creature. 
28 
The Communication of Thought or Intellect 
It must not be forgotten that all divine thought which comes to us through the invisible  communication of a good spirit, or a good intellect, should not be taken as divine will, but  rather only as thought. We call this communication of thought intellect, and it is according  to this communication that man operates his will. The same thing can be said about the  communication of bad thought or intellect in minors. 
29 
Adam, by Thinking, Becomes Pensive 
It is by leaving himself open to the communication of these kinds of good or bad  intellects, that the first man degenerated in his power as a thinking being. When Adam was  in his first state of glory, he did not need communication of good or bad intellect to know  the Creator’s thought and that of the prince of demons. He was able to read both equally  well, being totally a thinking being. But when left to his own virtues, powers, and free  will, he became susceptible, through pride, to good and bad communication and thereby  became what we call pensive. The Christ himself showed us the infirmity of the minor in  this respect, since the prince of demons likewise tempted him under an apparent human  form and plainly operated his diabolical will against him, on Mount Tabor. It is only after  the bad intellect’s insinuation that the minor conceives his bad will and thus the first man’s  transgression was conceived and carried out.
18 
30 
God Obliged to Crown Adam’s Tainted Work 
I have apprised you of the nature of the transgression with the same certainty that it  was taught to me by one of my faithful friends, beloved of truth and protected by wisdom.  You have seen that the first God-man of the Earth, in fact, produced a terrible operation by  creating a material form in his image and resembling his glorious corporeal form. I have  explained that the form that Adam created was not a glorious one, that it could only be an  apparent form of matter, and imperfect at that, since it was the result of the operation of bad  will. Since Adam abused his power, his operation could not go unpunished by the Creator. 
However, the Eternal, having sworn to Adam that He would act with him in every  operation made in His name, could not prevent Himself from fulfilling that immutable  promise to assist him in every circumstance that he would need it. It is with this promise  that Adam set off to manifest the power innate in him toward every spiritual being. He  reminded the Creator of this immutable promise that He had made to crown his works.  God, bound by His oath and His immutability, joined His spiritual operation to Adam’s  temporal one, albeit against His will. The Creator acted with Adam like he wanted, and  crowned his work by locking a minor within the material form created by Adam. This poor  Adam subjected a minor to a dreadful prison of darkness and thus made him susceptible to  being pensive and thinking by precipitating him into eternal privation. 
31 
Adam’s Pensive and Thinking Posterity 
The word pensive comes from a bad intellectual connection to a minor being who, by  the nature of his divine spiritual being, was emanated as a thinking being, wholly within the  Creator’s immensity. This intellectual joining caused the degeneration of the minor from  this first state and forced him to be pensive through the intellectual notions that he received  from the bad spirit. It is not surprising that Adam became a pensive and thinking being after  his transgression. Neither is it surprising that his entire posterity became likewise. 
This last fact is plainly proven by the different ways of thinking, acting, and operating  that we are witnessing among the generations of our first father. Among these descendants,  we see different nations, different languages, different forms of divine and material worship,  and an infinite variety of revolutions, in general as well as in particular. Furthermore, we  see men, in all eras, communicate intimately and earnestly so as to educate each other  about their spiritual or material thoughts. It shows how little self-reliant and how self 
satisfied this posterity is with the inspiration that it receives from the good or evil spirit in 
19 
the dark places that it inhabits. Because Adam entered into a state contrary to his spiritual  nature, we call his posterity pensive and thinking, by the communication of this good and  bad intellectual being making man susceptible to being encircled. 
32 
Exceptional Men 
It should be noted, however, that there have been minors who have received birth and  temporal life through the sole will and divine operation. These minors were destined for the  manifestation of the Eternal’s glory and, although their form was emanated from Adam’s  posterity, the minor who dwelled in this form was truly a pure thinking being without ever  being a pensive one. And why is this? Because the Eternal demonstrated His will to one  of His deputies through a vision, and showed him, without any mystery, what exactly he  should do to operate the divine will. One thing is intellectual inspiration and another is the  act of visual operation of the spirit. This I will explain when I talk about the minors who  were emanated after Adam by the sole will of the Creator to manifest His glory. 
33 
Visible Figures of the Christ for the Reconciliation of Adam’s Two Generations 
In the earliest times of the first man’s generations, Hely, whom we call the Christ and  whom we undoubtedly recognize as a thinking being, reconciled Adam with the Creator.  Enoch reconciled Adam’s first descendants, under the descendants of Seth. Noah reconciled  Adam’s second generation, reconciling his with the Creator, and then reconciled the Earth  with this same second generation and in this way reconciled the earth with God. Melchizedek  confirmed these first three reconciliations, in blessing the works of Abraham and his three  hundred servants. This benediction is a repetition of God’s blessing of Noah’s three children  – namely Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Abraham and his three hundred servants form the  perfect 4 and recall to mind the same quaternary number which Noah had formed with his  three sons. It is through the octonary number, which is the result of joining two quaternary  numbers, that we find that all reconciliations and confirmations, of which we have just  spoken, were made directly by the Christ. For, although operated with the assistance of the  minors emanated for that purpose, these minors were only visible figures that the Christ  used to manifest the Creator’s glory and mercy for the benefit of the reconciled. 
We know for certain that the number 8 is the innate number of a double power, given to  the Christ by the Creator, and it is that number which tells us that the Messiah operated all  things for the benefit of the temporal men of Adam’s first and second generations. We look  upon the generation of Seth as Adam’s second generation because it made itself receptive to  reconciliation, and we do not include Cain’s generation because it is still to be reconciled,  and because it is still paying its debt to the Creator. We ought to understand this clearly  by the curse that Ham received from his father, Noah, after the ark came to rest on the 
20 
earth. His permanent exile in the southern part serves as an immemorial sign to men, from  generation to generation, that Cain’s posterity has not yet spiritually reintegrated in all its  personal virtues and powers, even though it no longer continues to exist on the face of this  earth. 
34 
Ham Prophesied by Noah’s Raven 
I will not leave you unaware of the fact that what became of Ham had been prophesied  by the tangible sign to Noah’s children who, nevertheless, did not understand it. This sign  was the escape of the raven which flew from the ark before the earth was sighted again. It  flew towards the south and did not come back. Those who stayed in the ark did not see it  again even after they came out. The raven’s flight shows us that no unfortunate or fortunate  event happens without man being able to foresee it or without him having some indication  or another of it happening. Provided he meditates on his thoughts, he will soon see the  good or the bad which will come of them, because the good intellect does not want to see  anything good or bad happen to the creature it protects without giving it some warning of  what to expect. 
35 
What Men Did the Christ Reconcile? 
Why has Adam’s first generation in Cain not yet been reconciled with the Creator, you  ask? Did not the Christ come to reconcile the living and the dead with the Creator? Did not  God the son, by his passion and the spilling of his blood, open the gates to the kingdom of  heaven to all those who had died in divine privation? Therefore Adam’s posterity in Cain  must be included in this reconciliation! 
My answer to this is that the Christ reconciled with God the father only those who were  marked with the seal of the spiritual operation of the righteous. This seal was sent to them  visibly and without any mystery about how it should be used for the benefit of those who  were to receive it, so as to strengthen themselves more and more in faith and confidence in  the Creator’s forgiveness, and so as to sustain, with invincible steadfastness, the powerful  manifestations of the divine which could be produced before them spiritually by the Christ  for all inhabitants of the earth living in divine privation. What I am telling you here was, in  fact, done by the Christ, as I shall explain more clearly. 
36 
The First Act of the Dead Christ: in Hell 
We cannot doubt the virtue and omnipotence of God the son, who is truly the direct  action of the Creator’s will, father of all things. We can doubt even less that the whole of 
21 
creation was operated by the Creator in the presence of His divine son, who said after each  operation of divine thought: “All is good.” If he could say something like that, then he must  have understood profoundly the principle of the Creator’s operating thought. In effect, he  knew all the goodness and validity of the sacred thoughts that the Creator operated in his  presence, and, filled with joy and delight, he applauded when he said: “I am in Thee and all  Thy works, almighty Creator, as Thou art in me and all my works. I have linked all things  in their limitations which Thou hast created, and as Thy will has commanded it. Whoever  follows Thee and me shall verify and acknowledge all of Thy works and mine, and shall  teach to all divine spiritual beings Thy will concerning the immutable laws upon which  every created being is founded.” 
It is by virtue of these same laws that every emanated being acts in his virtue, good or  bad, and that every temporal spiritual operation achieves its result, for whoever operates  for or against the Creator’s glory and creation. What serves to convince us is that it is the  Christ himself who directed the operations of the righteous, of which I have just spoken,  for the benefit of those minors who became slaves to demons, and on behalf of those who  still suffer all the persecutions from evil spirits. More particularly, we shall learn of this  by the three days that the Christ remained unknown to the earth and its inhabitants. The  first day, he descended into places of the greatest divine privation, commonly called hell,  to deliver minors marked by the seal of reconciliation from horrible bondage. That was  truly his first act because he had come to men only to carry out divine justice against the  Creator’s enemies. 
37 
The Second Act of the Dead Christ: on Behalf of Holy Patriarchs and Slaves of  Demons 
The Christ’s second act was done for the benefit of the righteous whom we call holy  patriarchs, and who are still paying their dues to the Creator’s justice, not for having led  a criminal existence, nor for bad spiritual conduct, but only to purge the blemish they  acquired from the time spent in a material form, and into which they descended through  Adam’s transgression, whereas they should have an incorruptible and glorious body such  as the Christ showed us in a physical way by his glorious resurrection. The Messiah –  which means divine spiritual regenerator – had prepared, through his doubly powerful  operation, the patriarch minors who, during their temporal life should have been the true  representatives of his advent and his omnipotence for the manifestation of divine justice to  be operated by him upon all emanated beings. 
Consequently, and to this end, these patriarch minors had received the doubly strong  feature of the Christ’s operation, by which they were forewarned of everything that he  was doing and had to do in the future, not only for their benefit, but for those minors who  existed in a divine privation considerably greater than their own. It is not surprising that 
22 
this reconciler would, by preference, have given this feature to the minors whom he himself  had prepared to serve as an instrument for the manifestation of the divine glory. Moreover,  he gave them the power to make this feature effective upon the minors in privation, so  that they could operate on behalf of these minors for the greatest glory of the Creator and  the greatest shame of the demons. It is because of this divine spiritual preparation that the  regenerator worked first on the most oppressed minors, having more need of his help than  those who already knew, through the Christ himself, of all the things that he did for the  Creator’s greatest glory. 
No doubt you want to know what this feature was which he placed upon the holy  patriarchs; it was a major spiritual being more powerful than these glorious minors,  and which they could recognize only by the different spiritual actions that he operated  amongst the reconciled but not yet regenerated minors. The operation of the Christ on  these patriarch minors produced an incomprehensible change in them; they became more  definitely convinced than they had ever been during their fleeting life of the inviolable  tenderness that the Creator has and will have eternally for his creature, since he has not  created it in order to lose it except if it chooses to do so of its own accord. By virtue of  this powerful feature that the righteous minors had received, the Christ – this name means  receptacle of divine operation – operated an action entirely opposite to what they had had  in the past by laying out before the reconciled minors a work quite different from what they  had performed during their first temporal stage, as can be understood most clearly by the  different customs practiced among the inhabitants of this earth. 
A similar feature had been placed on the demons’ slaves coming from the holy operation  of the glorious patriarchs who operated the Christ’s will, together with the major and  doubly powerful spiritual beings. In this way, the demons’ slaves received the seal of divine  reconciliation, but a stronger seal, in truth, than one put on the patriarch minors, given that  this seal was to operate only very succinct things, whereas the seal put upon the slaves  of the demons was to carry out more considerable feats. And, although the change which  occurred to the patriarch minors was very pronounced, it was infinitely less than that of  the demons’ slaves, because the spirit which operated in these minors had two actions to  produce – that is, their reconciliation and the punishment of perverse majors. These were  the first and second acts of the Christ during the first two of the three days that he remained  unknown to men in order to give us the example of his burial and spiritual resurrection  before the whole of creation. 
38 
The Third and Double Operation of the Dead Christ: 
On the Minors Enclosed within Divine Privation 
Christ’s third operation alludes to the third day of his burial and was made on two kinds of  minors who were more or less enclosed within divine privation. Hence, this third operation 
23 
was divided into two substances, one visible and the other invisible to ordinary mortals,  given that matter cannot see and conceive the spirit without dying or without the spirit  dissolving or obliterating all matter as it appears. The invisible substance of Christ’s third  operation consists of having shortened the works and difficult operations that the minors  performed and which conformed to the length of time that the Creator had prescribed in  their general and particular universal course. 
39 
The Three Circles of Man’s Progress: 
The Sentient, Mental, and Rational 
The universal course to which the minor is subject is made known by careful study, which  men of all ages, including this century, have undertaken of the three spherical principles  to attain the different means of traveling across the entire surface of the earth with greater  sureness. Some consider these three circles only as a means to satisfy their material greed  due to the little understanding that they have of these circles, and their flawed motivation  for study. I acknowledge that these three circles – called sentient, visual, and rational –  have in them the property to instruct man in the knowledge of space and the boundaries of  universal, general, and particular creation. However, men must be in great darkness if they  look at these circles only from a material point of view. Spiritually, we attach the minor  circle to the sentient, the visual to the mental, and the major circle to the rational, and  these circles are nothing other than a distinct expanse in which the impartial minors will  complete the operation of their temporal action, invisible to corporeal man. 
This operation starts in the sentient circle. From there, the minors enter the visual circle  where the height of their spiritual operation is accomplished, and which we call operational  reaction since the extent of this second circle is infinitely greater than the first where the  minors completed their natural course of operation. Then they go on to enjoy their deserved  rest in the obscurity of their reconciliation, into the circle we call rational. All the different  planetary and elementary bodies reside in the spaces of these three principal circles, which  we recognize by the three principal divine powers certainly active in them, as I will explain  by the three following numbers: the number 4 is given to the minor, the number 7 is given  to the spirit, and the number 8 is given to the double spirit which is the Christ. The Christ  presides over the spirit, the spirit over the minor, and the minor presides over the earthly  form. It is the first substance of the Christ’s third operation, therefore, which shortens  the course and activities of the minors so that they can then rest in the obscurity of their  reconciliation.
24 
40 
The Plan Outlined to Men by the Christ 
The second visible substance to corporeal men is made up of the plan that the Christ  himself outlined for them, either by his resurrection or by the teachings that he left to his  elected faithful through his divine spiritual word. In full sincerity, this is what I know and  what I have been told concerning the reconciliation made by the Christ, a reconciliation  truly prepared by the Christ’s elected righteous, to whom he gave the first example, as I  shall explain to you. 
41 
Manifestations of the Christ before the Christ 
Hely reconciled the first man with the Creator, by the mediation of his spirit which  joined with the first emanated minor. Enoch, through his justice, acted for the benefit of  the generation of Seth’s children, the living as well as the deceased, to whom he passed  on the feature or authentic seal of his operation. With this seal, he marked those who were  worthy of accompanying the Christ when he was to account to his father Creator about the  operations that he had performed for his greatest glory and for the shame of his enemies.  Noah repeated the same things, as did Melchizedek, Elijah, Zorobabel, and the Christ.  These are the ones who were appointed by the order of the Creator to mark the minor  spiritual beings, who were to accompany the triumph of the manifestation of divine justice  operated by the power of the divine God-man in accordance with the Creator.

The Righteous Cooperated in the Identification of the Marked 
I will not describe the details of the different operations that the righteous made to  cooperate in the identification of those marked and who were definitely to form the Christ’s  court when he went in spirit to face the Creator, father of all authority and immutable divine  power. But you may well ask me how the reconciliation of the minors was performed by  the righteous just mentioned. Was not every event, temporal or spiritual, forewarned by the  immutable laws that the Creator had given to His universal creation? My answer is that you  should realize that God could not prevent what He had not foreseen, being unable to read  into thought when it is conceived, as I have already explained, and being unable to destroy  the freedom of spiritual beings. We know that without this freedom, Adam could not have  transgressed, and his transgression produced such a change that the Creator was forced to  amend the operation of general and particular creation. By general creation is meant the 
25 
earth, and by particular creation is meant all the minors living in an earthly body as well  as a celestial one. Yes, you must know about this transgression which forced the Creator  to apply the divine laws throughout all of creation, although you may not understand it  perfectly.

Moses, Example of Adam’s Transgression and Reconciliation 
You know that the Creator emanated Adam, God-man, just from the earth and that  he was placed in a glorious incorruptible body. You know that when he transgressed, the  Creator personally cursed him because of his tainted work, and then cursed the entire earth.  You also know that by this transgression, Adam degenerated from his glorious form into  a form of earthly matter. Through me, you will come to know that all these things would  not have been able to occur within particular and general nature, if the Creator had not for  a time suspended and withdrawn towards Himself the powers that He had given to the first  man in his state of justice. The change which took place from Adam’s glorious body to his  earthly one heralded the new laws that the Creator would give him when he was reconciled.  At the time of this reconciliation, the Creator blessed him a second time, pardoned his  error, and gave him a power inferior to the one that he had had before his crime, which  would last him until the time of his perfect reconciliation. 
This is clearly and physically demonstrated to us by the two different laws that Moses  brought down from the mountain. Moses only gave the people of Israel the first set of  laws. The transgression of these people forced Moses to break the tables, and in this way  deprive the Israelites of the divine law that they so earnestly desired to receive. After this  event, Moses reconciled himself with his people and promised them a second law from the  Eternal, a law that the Eternal was pleased to grant because of the reconciliation that He  had made with His elected people. This reconciliation could not come directly from the  sole power and will of Moses, but only from the Creator’s power. This is demonstrated by  the fact that all of the powers of one man are not capable of reconciling twenty others by  his will, and if Moses had operated only on his own and without the assistance of a superior  being, all of his words and efforts would have been useless. 
Let us judge this by comparing the efforts of men of this century who speak crudely of  those of the first centuries. How and in what way can those of this century be reconciled if  they have never seen any physical manifestation of a divine or spiritual kind, manifestations  of immutable laws which should activate and maintain universal creation for the period  of time prescribed by the Creator? Perhaps you would like to know what the length of  time this period is, but it is not the place to discuss this with you now. I shall pursue the  explanation of Adam’s transgression, because it is from this that all of the different events  have arisen since the beginning of the world until our day, and which will continue until  the end of time.

Houva1 or “Hommesse”- Fruit of Adam’s Transgression 
The pain Adam felt by becoming pensive and thinking was nothing other than what  had to manifest during the first of these unfortunate eras which arose with his posterity,  and which resulted in Adam understanding most profoundly the gravest consequence of  his transgression. He experienced it by the trouble, agitation, and different struggles which  took place within him when he was restricted in his second body of earthly matter. In this  state, he lamented to the Creator, he begged for clemency from the living God – who is the  Christ – and the vivifying God. In his somnolence, the spirit presented him with the fruit of  his transgression, which filled him with consternation and which increased the acuteness of  his remorse while reflecting on his works. He thought about what the Creator was asking of  him. This poor man felt that he had to sincerely acknowledge his error, confess that he had  committed it, and how he committed it. Obedient to divine will, Adam admitted with the  greatest sincerity to the work of his cursed thought and the action of his own will, which  linked him to the fruit of his work for time immemorial. He confirmed this confession by  giving to the fruit of his transgression the name of Houva, or Hommesse, which means flesh  of my flesh, bones of my bones, and the work of my operation conceived and exercised by  my soiled hands. This is what you were seeking to know regarding Adam’s transgression. 
45 
The Decree of Original Sin 
What I have just said to you about Adam’s transgression and the fruit which came from  it demonstrates to you quite clearly what our spiritual and physical nature is like, and how  much both have degenerated because the soul became subject to the suffering of privation  and the form became passive in contrast to what it would have been had Adam united his  will with the Creator’s. From this you can also more or less recognize what we spiritually  call decree, pronounced in the name of the Eternal against Adam’s generations until the end  of time, and what we commonly call original sin. 
46 
Change to Ceremonial Laws 
Now I must explain more clearly the change of the ceremonial laws operating in general  and particular creation in relation to the first man’s crime. I have explained to you the  power, virtue, command, and authority of the first emancipated minor in his glorious body.  I have also shown you how, by his crime, he transmuted himself from this glorious form  into one of earthly matter. But this second material body had the same apparent image as  the glorious body in which Adam had been emanated. There was therefore a change only  
1 Eve or woman.
27 
in the laws by which Adam would be governed. When a temporal created being changes  his action, he necessarily changes the laws of operation. When the Creator reconciled  general, universal, and particular creation, there was a change in the laws which directed  this creation before it was cursed and then reconciled. It was the same for the first man.  Having changed his first glorious state, it was absolutely necessary that the Creator change  the first laws of operation which He had given him, these laws being no longer suitable for  the action and direction of a bodily form as restricted as the one that Adam was bound to  assume by divine authority. 
The laws governing the corporeal forms of apparently passive matter are not, as you  may appreciate, those which govern every minor spirit, agent, and governor of a glorious  bodily form and which does not draw its origin from the matter which we see physically  condensed. The glorious form does not embody the minor spirit or any other in divine  privation, because this form is known by the minor or every other spirit sent by the Eternal  to manifest the glory of this divine Being in men and anywhere else that the Creator pleases.  Moreover, I can say that Adam and his posterity, being held in this form of earthly matter,  did not have to worship the Creator in the same way for which the first man had been  emanated. If the first minor changed form, he would of necessity have had to change in  operation. This new action is extremely limited by the force of the laws that the Creator  exercised against Adam and his generations until the end of time. 
47 
The Word of Creation Put to Adam by the Eternal in His Image 
This limited action should not surprise you, given Adam’s iniquitous use of the first  Word that the Eternal had given him so that he could produce a divine posterity. This Word,  which you may not know, and perhaps consider to be something incomprehensible, was  only the intent and the will that the first man had to carry out by his powerful Word. But  to understand more clearly the Word of God’s posterity that Adam had innate in him, it is  necessary to go back to the knowledge of the different Words that the Creator used for His  universal creation, in which are found the particular and the general, according to His intent,  His will, and His Word, from which every action, form, and spiritual minor is derived. By  joining these last three things – intent, will, and word – to the three preceding ones, I shall  make the three principal Words that the Eternal used to create all things understood. 
Intent is linked to the creation of the universe, which is illustrated by a large circle inside  which the general and the particular are put into action and movement. Will is linked to the  creation of the general, or the earth, which is illustrated by a triangle, just like the image  that the Creator conceived in His thinking imagination, and word is linked to the specific  emanation of the spiritual minors living in the particular corporeal form, similar to that of  the earth and which was similarly produced according to the image of divine thought. It is  by this and what is to follow that we can understand the Word of creation that Adam had in 
28 
his power. If the Creator had no intent, He would not have had any will; if He had no will,  He would not have had word or action. Now, since the spiritual minor being is only the  fruit of the operation of these three divine principles, the first man to be the God-man on  the earth had to bear the marks of his origin and these three principles innate in him when  the Eternal detached him from His divine immensity. We have previously seen that God  could not be the author of evil, thus Adam was emanated in goodness and justice. Adam  therefore had within him a powerful Word, because from his spoken command, according  to good intent and divine spiritual will, there were to come forth glorious impassive forms  like those which appeared in the Creator’s imagination. 
These glorious forms could not be earthly material forms which were destined according  to the Creator’s will to serve as a prison to the transgressor spirits, and the form into which  Adam was placed was purely spiritual and glorious, so that he could have dominion over  all of creation, and freely exercise over it the power and command that the Creator had  given him. This glorious form is nothing but an apparent image which the spirit conceives  and nurtures according to the needs and orders that it receives from the Creator. This form  is as swiftly reintegrated as it is fathered by the spirit. We call it impassive because it is  not subject to any elementary influence whatsoever, pure and simple. It is not susceptible  to any food, unless the spirit itself provides it. No particle of the central fire can act on it.  Finally, this glorious form would have been perpetuated by Adam for the reproduction of  his spiritual posterity, just as his carnal posterity is known to us, but without any principal  material operation, however, as the advent and the resurrection of the Christ and the descent  of the divine spirit in the temple of Solomon have shown us. 
48 
Intent, Will, and Action Determine the Word of Creation 
By everything which has been said, we cannot doubt the considerable changes to the  laws of operation resulting from the first man’s transgression, whether on the general and  particular body, or on the minors and the very operations they have to carry out today,  and which are contrary to those for which they had been emanated. Furthermore, we have  seen a glimmer of this famous ternary number of creation of all forms by the joining of  intent, will, and word, which produces divine action, and which is certainly the Word. In  fact, of what use would intent be without will, will without word, and word without effect  or action? There must have been intent, will, and word to operate each of these parts of  creation, but it is word which determined the action of divine intent and will. 
It is by this determination that the Word came to be, and therefore it is certainly within  the Creator’s Word that the ternary number of universal, general, and particular creation  exists, and nowhere else, for intent, will, and word produce a spiritual effect or action,  which shows that the Word of creation is not produced from itself, because it is emanated  from the intent, will, and word of the Creator. It is also by this Word and its emanation that 
29 
we recognize with certainty that the first ternary number of whatever creation is co-eternal  with God as follows: intent (1), will (2), and word (3), from which action or the Word  arises. Add these three numbers and you will find 6, as follows: 1 and 2 make 3 and another  3 make 6. This completes the six thoughts of universal, general, and particular creation of  the Eternal, and this number is certainly in universal, general, and particular creation. 
49 
Necessity of the Reconciliation of Men 
By everything that I have just told you, you should understand from where every created  spiritual and material being came, as well as the great power which the first man long ago  enjoyed and which his generations can still enjoy today. This power, however, is of little  consequence if man does not make his reconciliation with the Creator. I will go so far as  to say that it is worth nothing without it, and that the brute has more virtue in his passive  instinct alone than the spiritual minor when he has degenerated and what he destroys  through divine spiritual inaction to the point of becoming the tomb of death. What I mean  by the expression, the tomb of death, is that the poor minors who are not reconciled will  become the prey of perverse spirits and, by joining them, will cause them to remain in their  reprobation for an eternity. 
50 
The Triple and Quadruple Divine Essence in Dealing with the Minor 
This then will be the fate of minors who have not followed the Creator’s law. See  how much we have to keep on our guard and strive to imitate Adam who, after having  sincerely confessed his crime and with the bitterest regret obtained his reconciliation from  the Creator and was partly restored in his former virtues and powers upon the three kinds  of temporal creation, on the condition, however, that his future intent and will conform to  the laws of his reconciler. Reflect on this reconciliation and you will always see the ternary  number – namely, Adam, the Christ, and the Creator. You will see that this triple divine  essence very clearly forms the three principles of all creation as follows: the intent of the  father (1), the will of the Christ (2), and the word of the spiritual minor which arises from  the intent and the will of the two former (3). I put the minor among the first three divine  essences because he is the product of the intent of the Father, the will of the regenerator  son, and the action, of divine spirit. I shall explain this more clearly when I describe the  quadruple divine essence about which I do not intend to keep you ignorant, even though I  have not yet mentioned it.
30 
II. CAIN 
51 
Cain, Born from a Wild Passion 
I shall continue to discuss the first man’s perfect reconciliation. When the Creator  blessed Adam and his tainted work, He said: 
“Adam, enhance your work so that together you may reproduce a posterity of particular  forms in which the universal and general form will be contained beyond doubt and with  certainty, just as the image is contained in the form that you are directing for the period of  time that I have set down.” 
The Scriptures relate these words as follows: “Grow and multiply.” That is, when Adam  and Eve were sent from their first place of action, He commanded them to reproduce forms  like their own. They carried out this command with such a furious passion of their material  senses so as to delay the first man’s entire reconciliation. Nevertheless, they created the  bodily form of their first son whom they named Cain, which means “son of my sorrow.”  This name was given to him by Adam because he really felt that he had conducted an action  driven by a wild passion and contrary to the moderation that he should have used (Let us  say in passing that the command made directly to Adam by the Creator for his reproduction  teaches us that the Creator had made him the guardian of his reproductive seed.) 
Adam was right to name his first-born “son of my sorrow” because through this act his  reconciliation was deferred, and by this same act and the name of Cain that he had given  to his first-born, he prophesied the great sorrow that he would experience in the future  by the severe transgression of his descendants, who would contravene the divine laws,  precepts, and commands, and this is why Adam was acknowledged as the first prophet  by these descendants. However, this son, begotten by a passion contrary to the Creator’s  command, had to contribute to the first father’s reconciliation through the intense suffering  that he would make him feel, by repeating the evil of his first transgression which Cain  mysteriously carried out in Adam’s presence. This was the cruelest blow and the most  bitter remorse that he could create in his father’s heart. It is also not possible to imagine  what Adam’s pain and despondence were like when he saw his first son fall victim to  diabolical powers. No one but this first father could judge the sorrow that he and his son  had to experience, since it was not long since Adam himself had been delivered through the  Creator’s absolute mercy from the hands of these same demons who had just seduced his  first son and plunged him forever in divine privation.
31 
52 
Kani, Worthy Sister of Cain 
Through this double sorrow, Adam strengthened in faith and confidence in the Creator.  He bemoaned more than ever of having cooperated in the conception of this poor son  outside the Creator’s prescribed limits. He voluntarily submitted to the Creator’s will by a  genuine oath and promised never, under any circumstances, to stray from the laws, precepts,  and commands that the Creator would outline. But this first father’s submission was only  apparent. He did not have the perseverance to which he had sworn; on the contrary, with his  companion Hommesse or Eve, he conceived a female generation that he named conjointly  Kani 11, which means “child of confusion,” because this conception was brought about  according to the same laws under which Cain had been conceived. 
53 
Abac, Worthy Sister of Cain and Kani 
Five years later, the liaison that he saw between his first two children made him believe  that the time had come when all his sorrows would end. Again, he shut his eyes to the  truth and conceived with Houva, or Eve, a third descendant, who was a female, and whom  he named Abac 9, which means “child of matter,” or “child of divine privation.” Adam  thus remained six years without producing descendants because, during this interval and  from the time of the birth of his third child, he fell into a great despondency. Such an  intense disgust with himself took hold of him that he did not know what to become. He  fell into total inaction whether for divine or diabolical spiritual purposes, no longer being  sensitive to either good or bad impressions. Eventually, he became like a newly born child.  What made him like this was the undeniable knowledge that he had of all his past crimes  against the Creator. The good spirit in him gave him this knowledge and made him clearly  understand that the earth that he had cultivated up to then, against the Creator’s commands,  would produce only sorrow and bitterness in him and would be the poison of discord for  all his descendants. 
III. ABEL 
54 
Abel and Three Younger Ones Conceived in Purity 
When chasing Adam from earthly paradise, the Creator made these threatening words,  as the Scriptures report: “Go and cultivate the earth; it will give you only brambles.” I ask  whether there are bramble thorns sharper than those that a criminal descendant can pierce  into the heart of a good father? The Creator had announced that these evils would happen  to the first man’s acts in earthly matter, but it was in this ruined state that He intended to  forgive the first man’s weaknesses by preparing him and his companion to work together in 
32 
a pure and simple conception without excessive participation of their material senses. And  so Adam’s descendants were not limited to the three children that I have just mentioned,  but he had four more, two males and two females, and it was the first of these four – a son  – who had to bring about his father’s reconciliation. Thus Adam, along with his companion  Eve, carried out an operation pleasing to the Creator, and she conceived the seed that Adam  had scattered into her womb and which she happily kept until its maturity. 
55 
Abel, Child of Peace, or a Being Elevated above Every Spiritual Sense 
It was not particularly surprising that Eve took special care of this new fruit, because  she felt a peace, a joy, and an inexpressible satisfaction grow within her instead of the  intense and cruel pain that she felt during the whole time that she had carried her first three  children. This difference came from the gifts that the grace of the Eternal had impregnated  into the soul of this fourth child, which in turn communicated to her its innocence, candor,  and pureness. Even Adam became content and joyous again, which increased Eve’s  gladness even more. They looked with particular happiness upon the time this last fruit was  conceived; it was during the seventh year after Adam had his first three children. He could  not help praising the Lord for this event by saying, “The Eternal, Creator of heaven and  earth and his servant, Adam, or Reaux, be forever blessed for all that He has created! It is  from Him that I have a fourth descendant who will be my complete satisfaction in life here  below and in times to come.” He called this child Aba 4, which means “child of peace,” or  Abel 10, which means a being elevated above every spiritual sense. 
56 
Like Adam and Eve We have Elizabeth and Zacharias, Mary and Joseph 
Everything that I have just said was repeated in physical kind, towards the middle of  time, by the pregnancy of Mary and of Elizabeth, by the thrill that Elizabeth felt growing  in her soul when she greeted her cousin, Mary, who had come to visit her, and by the  contentment that the two temporal fathers felt, one for the physical operation of their work  and the other for the unique spiritual operation that the Eternal had manifested for the  benefit of his adopted wife. The explanation of this will be seen elsewhere. Let us here  follow Adam’s descendants. 
57 
Abel’s Devotion, a Type of Christ 
Adam and Eve took particular care of this fourth child. They never let him out of their  sight although neither yet knew completely what fruit they would reap later. They did not  grow weary of admiring his conduct, either towards his two sisters and his brother, Cain,  or towards his mother and father. From the tenderest age, no more than three years old, 
33 
he tried to win their friendship, and all the while his goodness, wisdom, virtue, and good  example increased while living among the earth’s righteous. This blessed child constantly  endeavored to direct spiritual devotion to the Creator, which surprised his entire family.  
All of his acts aimed to calm God’s justice towards His first minor creature and  descendants, knowing by these acts how severely this generation was going to be struck  by divine justice. In effect, Abel behaved towards the Eternal like Adam should have done  in his first state of glory; the devotion Abel directed to Him was exactly the kind that the  Creator expected from his first minor. Abel was still a striking example of the manifestation  of divine glory which was carried out by the true Adam, or Reaux, or the Christ, for the  perfect reconciliation of past, present, and future descendants of the first man, in return  for which these descendants would make full use of the plan of action pure divine mercy  would set out for them, just as Abel had already predicted by all his actions towards Adam  and Adam’s three first-born. 
58 
Rivalry between Abel and His Three Older Siblings  
The conduct of Adam’s three first-born first born was quite the opposite of Abel’s. The  more that Adam and Eve were impressed by their son, Abel, the more their three first-born  became their brother’s enemy. Adam and Eve regarded Abel as an interpreter of the spiritual  and the divine, and they observed carefully everything he said and made them do, in joy  and holiness. The three first-born, on the contrary, opposed everything that Abel carried out  for their own benefit, and for their father’s and mother’s benefit. They even went so far as  to set traps in order to destroy and physically remove him, which they did as we shall see. 
59 
Adam Acts with Abel and Cain 
One day, Adam, with his two sons, wanted to make a divine spiritual offering to the  Creator, but his female descendants could not be present because of their lack of virtue  and spiritual power, and, because of their lack of strength and steadfastness to sustain  similar acts, Adam kept the women away at a distance of 45 cubits from the place that  he had chosen for his work. When everything was in readiness, Adam commanded and  consecrated his last-born, Abel, to be the first to exercise the spiritual functions of the  proposed offering. Abel immediately prepared himself to fulfill this obligation. He set up  the altar, or the proper circles, in the center of which he offered the first fragrances. These  fragrances were his own corporeal form offered in sacrifice to the Creator while prostrating  himself in humility. At the same time, he submitted his spiritual minor being to the Eternal,  to be the receptacle of divine justice, where the Eternal would manifest His most merciful  glory for the benefit of Adam, His first minor creature. (Adam occupied the top end of the  altar, or the side of the circles facing North, and Cain occupied the side facing South.)
34 
After Abel fulfilled his spiritual functions as instructed, he withdrew from his prostrate  position and told his father what he had learned from the Creator. Adam then put Abel in his  position on the northern side, and, trembling, prostrated himself as Abel had done. When  finished, he called his two sons, placing Abel on his right and Cain on his left, and in this  position he related what he had learned from the Creator. 
“I want to let you know,” he said, “in the name of the Eternal creator, that I have  obtained grace before Him; His justice will no longer be upon me by the intermission  and intervention of the act of worship of my son, Abel, by whom the Creator has granted  holiness on my behalf. Come, my two sons, that I may share my joy with you, and tell you  about the two feelings that I have just experienced – that of evil and goodness which make  my reconciliation perfect with the Creator.” 
Then addressing himself to Cain, he said, “My first-born son, may your future works be  like those of your younger brother. Learn from me that the Creator offers his trust without  any distinction of temporal or spiritual origin, and that he grants all divine, spiritual, and  superior power to whomever deserves it, and to whom it is due. May your will in the future,  Cain, be the same as your brother’s and like mine, which, from now on, will be inviolably  that of the Creator.” 
60 
Example of the Double Ternary in the Preceding Ceremonial: 
Good and Evil 
This ceremonial act started in the middle of the day and lasted only about an hour.  When the work was finished, the participants left, each for their normal destination, Cain  alongside his sisters and Abel alongside his mother and father. This division of three persons  on each side offers us an image too striking to overlook. The image is a true example of the  separation of good and evil, and shows us again the three spiritual essences which make  up the corporeal forms of apparent matter, as well as those of rational and irrational being.  Join these two ternary numbers together and you will see, by its senary product, the number  of divine creation, or the six thoughts of the Creator for universal, general, and particular  creation. See if you will not find what the Scriptures teach; that three (3) are above, as  three (3) are below. Look further to see which of the two ternary numbers represents evil.  Finally, reflect on this matter and search within yourself for satisfactory convictions and  conclusions. 
61 
Cain, Dismissed, Acts Diabolically against Abel 
Cain, having withdrawn to the place that Adam had designated for him, revealed to his  two sisters the so-called insult that his father had made to him by taking away his birthright, 
35 
to make him dependent on his younger brother, Abel, and to make him subordinate to  Abel’s will. Cain’s two sisters encouraged him to use all his strength and power against his  father and brother, even against the Creator who had allowed such a heinous thing to favor  a younger brother who had amazed the good faith of their father and corrupted his good  thought through the ceremony of false and unjust devotion. 
Consequently, Cain conceived to carry out an act of worship to the false gods or princes  of demons, so that they might give him a superior power like that given to his brother,  Abel, by the Creator, and to avenge the supposed wrong that he had received from his  father because of his brother. He asked his two sisters to be present, just as Abel and he  had witnessed with their father’s act. He sanctioned his younger sister to perform the same  functions that Abel had carried out, and he followed in detail the ceremony that he had seen  performed. And when it was his turn to prostrate himself, he placed his other sister in the  position that he had at the altar, or in the circles, and prostrating himself, offered the form  and life of Abel as sacrifice to the princes of demons (the form is the body and the life is  the soul). 
62 
The Murder of Abel by Cain 
After this ceremony, Abel went to his brother, Cain, who reproached him bitterly. Abel  took this calmly and with humility, and answered him: 
“It is not against me nor your temporal father that you should direct your anger, but fight  against yourself and against the one who is directing you at this moment, for I tell you that  you have just performed a false and impious act of worship before the Eternal. The extent  of your crime surpasses Adam’s; you have offered your god of darkness a sacrifice which  neither you nor he is free to do, and you have wrongly sought to shed the blood of the  righteous for the justification of the guilty.” 
Abel then turned to find Adam and revealed to him all that had happened, which grieved  his poor father very much and caused him the greatest consternation. Abel tried to console  Adam and questioned him about his sadness and despondency, but Adam did not answer. It  seemed as if he could see what was going to happen to his beloved son, and dared not tell  him. Abel reassured Adam about all these worries saying firmly: 
“Father, what is decreed by the Creator for you and your descendants’ benefit must come  to pass, for good or for bad, because the general creation which you see is nothing but the  place that the Eternal has set aside to make manifest His omnipotence for His greatest glory.  For that reason, father, the Creator will place suitable subjects into your bodily descendants  to be His true instruments for the triumph of His justice, to the advantage of the good, and  to the shame of the wicked. It is useless for man to go against what the Creator has planned  for or against His spiritual creature.”
36 
Adam appeared calm, and, speaking to the Creator, said, “O Thou Eternal! May what is  conceived by Thy thought and Thy will be accomplished by Thy faithful servant, father of  the many nations which will inhabit and operate in Thy universal circle! Amen.” 
Adam and Abel then visited Cain, who greeted them with his two sisters. The daughters  embraced their father, and Cain embraced his brother, Abel, but in this embrace, Cain  struck Abel three times with a wooden instrument shaped like a dagger. The first blow  pierced his throat, the second his heart, and the third his stomach. This murder took place  in Adam’s presence without this poor father realizing it. But as soon as the murder had  been committed, Adam felt a terrible shock. Cain’s and Abel’s two sisters experienced the  same, and all three, struck by this shock, fell on the ground shouting, “Our conciliator, O  Lord, is taken away from us by the hand of the impious, we call for Thy justice and to Thee  alone we will leave our revenge!” (See with what guile the demon’s subjects disguised  themselves in the eyes of the creature by supposed spiritual and laudable words.) This  shock, although quite natural among the aforementioned, and based on the sympathy of  their material senses, came from yet another cause, which was the same cause that had  brought them down. It came from their perception of Abel’s spiritual major and minor, and  which they could not withstand without fainting. 
Adam stood up first and went back along with Abel’s spiritual minor and major to  find Eve, to whom he told everything that the Creator had required from him for his total  reconciliation; that his crimes had just been atoned for by Abel’s sacrifice, and that all was  thus consummated. I will leave you to think about what the sorrow must have been for this  poor father and his companion. Aren’t these the famous brambles which pierced Adam’s  heart? Isn’t this the fatal bramble produced on Earth by Adam’s transgression? And so it  is Eve who produced in Cain the instrument of poor Adam’s curse, having conceived with  him this son by an act of confusion, as the number two (2) shows us, and which I shall  explain in detail here and with sincerity. 
63 
Two, Number of Confusion 
The number of confusion is the one that directs what we call the simple and particular  operation, which is carried out by the minor’s will with the diabolical spiritual major. These  two subjects are one through the intimate connection of their thought, intent, and action.  However, they are always two separate subjects in that they are always susceptible to  disunity, which happens when a more powerful mediator comes between them and carries  out an opposite reaction. In this way, a considerable change comes into being for the benefit  of the minor in containing the action of the diabolical major. And so, it is the joining with  this diabolical being that we call the operation of confusion, and which we illustrate by the  number 2.

Two, Three, Four 
You may well ask, when the minor itself is joined to the good spiritual major, whether  this also makes the number 2 or confusion. But my answer is no, seeing that the good  spirit which joins itself with a minor cannot do so unless it has first communicated its spirit  intellect to the minor, which we call the minor spiritual power, and thereby prepares the  particular minor soul to receive impressions from the good major spirit, according to the  will and desire of this same major spirit and particular minor. The soul, by this junction,  acquires the number 2, which, joining with the spirit, forms a ternary number – namely, the  innate power of the first minor which is the soul (1); the minor power of the intellect (2);  and the direct power of the major spirit (3). 
This is how the soul of the minor makes the ternary number in its first principle of  spiritual junction. We do not count the joining of the soul with the diabolical intellect  and then with the bad spirit in the same way because, in this joining, the soul entirely  abandons its good spiritual power to become itself a demon’s intellect; whereas in this  joining with the good spirit, the soul maintains and strengthens its divine spiritual power,  which consequently deserves to be counted in this numbering. When the good major  spirit receives its immediate action from Divinity, the soul consequently has its regular  connection with the four divine powers, which we call quadruple essence as follows: the  minor soul, 1, which is in spiritual connection with the intellect, 2, intellect with the spirit,  3, and the spirit with Divinity, 4. This demonstrates the precise correspondence of every  spiritual being with the eternal Creator. 
Furthermore, I want to bring to your attention the correspondence of the heart of man  with every spiritual being. Man’s body is the organ of the soul and, through its use, the minor  makes his intent and will of spiritual action known to others by the different movements  and actions that he performs. The soul of the minor is the organ of the intellect, intellect is  the organ of the major spirit, and the major spirit is the organ of the divine Creator. Such  is the beautiful organic harmony of the principal divine spiritual beings, either of man’s  particular form or of the general and universal form, and this teaches us with certainty that  everything has truly been emanated from the first necessary Being to every other being,  spiritual or temporal. 
In fact, by the numbers I use, you should come to know the triple and quadruple divine  essence. These numbers are those that the Eternal Himself made use of to carry out general,  particular, and universal creation, and the emanation of spirits, whether those who have  become evil or those who have maintained the purity of their divine spiritual nature. The  ternary number will make known the ternary unity of spirituous essences which the Creator  used for the creation of different apparent material forms, and the quaternary number will  make known the divine spiritual number the Creator used for the spiritual emanation of 
38 
every living spiritual being, which are the major spirits given to the Christ and to the  demons and minors in privation who have fallen under their power. 
65 
Virtue of Numbers 
It is this virtue of numbers which has led sages of all ages to state that no man can be  learned without knowledge of numbers, whether in matters of the spiritually divine, the  celestial, the earthly, or general and particular. Knowledge of the laws of spiritual nature  is one thing; knowledge of the order and conventions of material man is something else  again. The laws of men change like the shadows; those of spiritual nature are immutable,  everything being innate in them since their first emanation. These truths will become more  evident as we go along in this treatise.

Abel Explained to Adam and Eve by the Eternal 
Let us continue with Adam and Eve’s reconciliation. Having experienced the cruel  pain of which we have spoken and not seeing anything positive about what this event  foreshadowed, either for themselves, their first descendants, or those to come, Adam and 
39 
Eve prostrated themselves in the greatest sorrow and faith before the Creator to ask for His  grace and mercy for the crime that Cain had committed on their son, Abel. Having neither  the power nor the strength to seek revenge by their own authority, through bloodshed  against the guilty one, they knew that vengeance belongs only to the Creator. The Eternal  answered Adam and Eve’s prayers and lamentations upon the death of their son, Abel; he  sent them a spiritual interpreter who appeared before them and explained the nature of the  crime committed by Cain, saying: 
“You are right to look upon Abel’s death as a great loss and as a sign of God’s wrath  which must fall upon your descendants until the end of time. You should also consider it as  the remaining curse of divine justice for the complete forgiveness of your first crime and  your perfect reconciliation. But the Creator, who knows your sincere change of heart and  submission, has sent me to soothe your pain and alarm about this unfortunate event which  you see as irreparable. 
“The Creator wants you to know, through my message, that you have both produced  Abel’s posterity only to be the true example of the one who will come in time to be the  genuine and sole reconciler of all of your descendants. You should both know that Cain,  whom you rightly consider a criminal, is no more a criminal than Adam was towards the  Creator. Cain only struck matter, but Adam took God’s throne by force; see which is the  more criminal! Your son Cain is still an example of the transgression of the perverse spirits  who seduced Adam and who really gave him spiritual death in plunging his minor being  into a form of passive matter, which made him susceptible to divine privation and changed  his glorious form to a material one subject to destruction, without being able to return to  its first state of apparent form after its reintegration in the first principle of apparent forms,  which the central axis will dissipate as quickly as it forms. Be firm and persevere in your  trust in the Eternal; the term of your reconciliation is fulfilled.” 
Adam replied, “May the will of my Creator be mine!” 
68 
First type of Preceding Events: The Major Spirits 
I will now begin an explanation of the true types which make up all of the events that I  have described. Adam, by his temporal posterity, can be taken as the Creator, and Adam’s  temporal posterity can be taken as the spirits that the Creator had emanated from Him for  His greatest glory and spiritual devotion. You have seen that these spirits can consider  themselves as Adam’s elders, having emanated before him. You also know that having  transgressed, these spirits were cast out from the Eternal presence, and that He emanated  and emancipated from His divine immensity a minor spiritual being to contain them in  privation. This minor, whom we call Adam, or Reaux, was therefore only the second-born  spiritually from these first spirits and, like them, came from the divine Father, Creator of  all things.
40 
I want to point out to you that Cain, Adam’s eldest son, is an example of the first spirits  emanated by the Creator, and that his crime is of the kind that the first spirits committed  against the Eternal. Abel, Adam’s second-born, by his innocence and holiness, is the  example of Adam emanated after these first spirits in his first state of divine righteousness  and glory. The destruction of Abel’s body, which was carried out by his elder brother Cain,  is the kind of operation that the first spirits carried out to destroy the glorious form in  which the first man was clothed and, by this means, made him susceptible to be like them  in divine privation. Here then is the true explanation of the first example that Adam, Cain,  and Abel demonstrated by the regrettable events which happened to them. 
69 
Second Type of Preceding Events: The Triangular Earth 
The second thing represented by these three minors is no less significant, either by the  correlation that they have with every celestial and terrestrial corporeal being, or by the  events that they announced would occur to the first man’s descendants. To be convinced  of this, we only have to note that Adam, by the three spirituous principles which make up  his form of apparent matter and its inherent proportions, is the exact image of the general  earthly temple, which we know to be an equilateral triangle, as we shall demonstrate later. 
70 
Power to Adam’s Corporeal Vegetation 
Adam had corporeal vegetation within his power, just as it is in Earth’s nature to  vegetate. Adam could produce only two sorts of vegetation, the masculine and the feminine.  Similarly, the earth can produce only two species of vegetation, whether in passive animals  or in plants. But I shall teach you that, besides the power that the body of man has to  reproduce itself in corporeal form, it also has the means to produce passive animals which  are really innate in the substance of this material form. How this is shall be explained next. 
71 
From the Putrefaction of Forms 
When the spiritual being has left its form, this form putrefies. After this putrefaction is  complete, corporeal beings called reptiles emerge from this form and survive until the first  three spirituous principles that have cooperated to make up the corporeal form of man are  reintegrated. You must not think that this putrefaction occurs of itself nor directly from the  corporeal form, but realize that the seminal fluid of all things subject to vegetation is innate  within the envelope, be it terrestrial or aquatic. 
Man’s body, having come from the general earth and having innate within its material  form the three principles which have cooperated to form his earthly or aquatic envelope, 
41 
there no doubt exists within this particular form yet another animal seminal fluid that is  likely to vegetate. It is through this seminal fluid that putrefaction occurs in the body after  what we commonly call death. The seminal ovaries throughout the entire body are knocked  together by the reaction of the three principles we call sulphur, salt, and mercury, operating  for their reintegration. In this way, the ovaries again receive an elementary warmth, stripping  the reptile of its envelope, and this envelope, once dissolved, connects itself intimately  with the cadaver’s damp material. 
The joining of this reptile envelope with the putrefied cadaver produces the general  decay of man’s body and finally ends its apparent form. It is therefore always by the reaction  of the three operating principles that putrefaction comes about, and this putrefaction brings  about the explosion of reptile animals whose seminal fluid is scattered throughout man’s  body. It is absolutely vital that this last work be done, and this is what is called the pain  or toil of the body. I would further point out to you that these reptile animals, which come  from the body, only have their action within the most essential moist base contained in the  cadaver. 
The life and activity that the animals have in the base fluid come from no other source  than the central fiery axis, which, through its last operation, gets rid of all of the impurities  surrounding the three spirituous essences which are still within the cadaver. The elementary  fire, along with the central fire, maintains the apparent form of these reptiles by the refraction  of their rays of spirituous fire, which consequently fold back into themselves when they  find no more fluid to operate – that is, when everything has been entirely consumed by  them. One can verify this by the form of the cadaver where the truth of what I am saying  concerning putrefaction can be seen. In explaining to you how these reptiles have life,  I mean that they have the same general life and corporeal form as all irrational animals  which receive their being only through these two fires. This is enough about putrefaction;  let me continue with an explanation of the types of children that Adam had. 
72 
Cain, An Example of the Seduction of Bad Spirits 
Besides the type of transgression of the first spirits and their victorious attack on the  first man, Cain is again a classical example of the impious and fatal seduction that bad  spirits will exercise upon the future generations of Adam, as they had just done in his first  generation. We see it in the first crime committed on his brother Abel, and the enticement  of his sisters to witness what he was going to bring about, as planned together. After his  transgression, Cain was obliged to go live with his two sisters in the southern part where  he was relegated permanently by the Creator’s command and by Adam’s authority. This is  the type of place to which the demons had been relegated so as to exercise their evil will  and intent either against the Creator or the minors of both sexes, who were liable to retain  some impression of the diabolical intellect.
42 
This southern place is again an example of the universal part where the Creator will  manifest His justice and glory at the end of time. It is also the place where the righteous  will manifest their virtue and power to the shame of the perverse spirits and outcast minors.  The southern part, having been cursed by the Creator, is marked by the Scriptures as the  refuge of the majors and minors who have transgressed. I will say, moreover, that the  three persons, Cain and his two sisters, by their ternary number, indicate the transgression  of the earthly corporeal form of man, which the diabolical intellect seduces through its  conjunction with the three spirituous principles making up every corporeal form. It is from  these three subjects that we come to the nonary number (the number nine), of prevaricating  matter, either of the demons or of the minors, as I will explain to you. 
73 
The Three Principles of Forms: Sulphur, Salt, and Mercury 
You know that the ternary number is given to Earth, or to the general form, and to  the corporeal forms of its inhabitants, as well as to the celestial inhabitants. This ternary  number originates from the three substances which make up any form whatsoever and  which we call the spirituous principles of sulphur, salt, and mercury, emanated from the  imagination and intent of the Creator. The central axis has placed and operated these three  principles, produced in a state of indifference, to allow them to take on a more strengthened  or consistent form, and from this action of the central axis come all corporeal forms in  the same way that the perverse spirits garb themselves for their greatest subjection. It is  also from these same substances that the corporeal forms of Cain and his two sisters are  composed, and we will explain this type now. 
74 
Of the Nonary Number 
In regard to the nonary number, I will say that it is not surprising that the major perverse  spirits and their agents prefer to bind themselves more willingly to the bodily form of man  than to any other, since this human form had first been destined for them. A proof of the  intimate liaison of the evil spirits with man’s body can be found in the words of the Christ  to his apostles at the end of his last temporal operation on the Mount of Olives. When  he came back to join them, he found them asleep and, waking them up, said, “Do not  sleep, for the flesh is weak and the spirit is quick.” It is the ease with which the evil spirit  communicates with the bodily form of man that allowed the spirituous principles within  these three persons’ forms to be corrupted. The diabolical intellect wormed its way into and  joined itself entirely with their form, and seduced the spiritual agent within who directs and  governs this form according to the Creator’s will. 
This insinuation produced such an impact that it was no longer within their power to  undo the intimate connection which ruled between them by the perfect sympathy that all 
43 
three had established with the demoniac intellect. There was among them only one intent,  one thought, and one action. Never had such a union been seen among men throughout the  centuries, and it is impossible that three different and free persons can act in this way if they  are not reconciled and led by a good or bad spirit. It is therefore from these three people,  possessed by the prince of demons, that, as I have said, we derive the nonary number of  matter, namely by adding the three spirituous principles or first essences; their three virtues  and their three demoniacal powers are as as follows: 
• Firstly, three principles to Cain, three to his elder sister, and three to his younger  sister, making nine. 
• Secondly, three virtues to Cain, three to his elder sister, and three to his younger  sister, making nine. 
• Thirdly, three powers to Cain, three to his elder sister, and three to his younger sister,  making nine. 
To convince you that the nonary number of matter comes from the three minors, we  have only to see their first diabolical action and how they perpetuated their criminal works  until the punishment that the Creator exercised over their entire generation – punishment  in which the Scriptures tell us that the Eternal had struck the entire earth and its inhabitants  by floods, and by this means destroyed the guilty generation of the three minors, as well as  men that they had seduced. It is since this period that the nonary number has come to our  knowledge, including its mysterious addition as follows: 
3 Add the product of 
3 all numbers which is 27; 
3 you will find that 2 and 7, summed make 9. 
3 Multiply 27 by 9; 
3 that will again 
3 give you 9. 
3 If you wish to multiply 
3 this product infinite times, 
3 it will always give 
27 you 9.
44 
75 
Cain’s Punishment 
This is all that I had to relate to you about the nonary number, wanting to tell you about  the other significant types that Cain represents in this universe. I will tell you that Cain is the  example of the choice of prophets that the Creator was to send amongst Cain’s generation  in the times which followed. You were told that when Cain had destroyed his brother Abel,  he went back to his ordinary abode, where, reflecting upon his crime, a divine spiritual  voice came to him and asked what he had done with his brother. Cain sharply replied, “Am  I my brother’s keeper?” After this response, the spirit made such an effect on his corporeal  form or minor being that he was immediately overwhelmed and, in this situation, called  upon the Creator, saying, “Lord, those who will meet me will kill me.” 
The Eternal, Father of mercy, considering Cain’s consternation, and wishing to protect  him from the reproach and revenge that his generation would be capable of exercising  against him, ordered that he be marked with a protective seal, and the spirit which marked  him thus said, “In the name of the Eternal, whosoever slayeth Cain shall be punished by  death sevenfold.” 
Then Cain withdrew with his sisters to the place where he had been sent by the Eternal.  Here he had a generation of ten males and eleven females. He built a city that he named  Enoch. To assist in this enterprise, he thought of the idea of digging into the bowels of  the earth, and he prepared the materials that he extracted so as to give them the forms  appropriate to the uses that he wanted to make of them. He undertook this operation with  his first-born, whom he called Enoch. He left his secret, however, either for the discovery  of mines or the beating of metals, to his second son, called Tubalcain. From this, it has  come to us that Tubalcain was the first to discover the smelting of metals. 
76 
Cain Killed by His Son Boaz 
Cain was a great hunter and he had also raised his male children in the art of hunting,  especially his tenth son, of whom he was very fond. He gave this son no other talents than  that of hunting, his other children being more inclined to works of the imagination and to  manual work. Cain named his tenth son Boaz which means “son of occision.” It was this  last son who killed his father Cain, which happened in the following manner. 
Cain, having resolved to go hunting for wild animals, accompanied by Enoch’s two  children, his grandchildren, did not tell his son Boaz about the hunting expedition that  he had planned two days later. For his part, Boaz planned with his two nephews, sons of  Tubalcain, to go hunting the same day as his father, but did not notify him either. Boaz,  having no children, became very fond of his nephews, and so they left together to go 
45 
hunting. Unknowingly, Boaz took the same route as his father, Cain, both being in the thick  bushes, called Onam, meaning “sorrow,” that they were accustomed to scouring. 
Then, Boaz saw the shadow of a figure. He let fly an arrow which pierced the heart of  his father, having taken him for a wild animal. Imagine Boaz’s surprise and shock when he  went to the place that he had shot the arrow, and when he saw that he had killed his father  by his own hand. His pain was all the greater because he knew that the punishment and  the threat that the Creator had leveled against the one who would strike Cain. He knew  that whoever would have that misfortune would incur mortal punishment seven times or  receive vengeance sevenfold (I will explain elsewhere this sevenfold revenge). Boaz called  his two nephews and showed them the body. As soon as they recognized that it was Cain,  they uttered a great cry of surprise and horror at the same time, increasing poor Boaz’s grief  even more. After he had told them how he was the innocent cause of the destruction of the  bodily form of his father, Cain, he said: 
“My friends, you are witnesses to my crime; although I have transgressed against the  commands of the Creator unwillingly, I am guilty before the Eternal and before men. I am  the youngest son of Cain, the last of his posterity, the most culpable and criminal. Avenge  upon the person of this last-born the death of his father and the scandal that I have brought  upon you.” 
The diabolical intellect, which knows the weakness of men in trouble, immediately  roused an excessive passion in Boaz’s two nephews to avenge Cain’s death. They each  armed their bow with an arrow to shoot their uncle. But when they were ready to shoot him,  a voice could be heard which said: 
“Whosoever shall slay the one who has killed Cain shall punished by death seventy by  sevenfold.” (This I shall explain later.) 
Upon hearing this frightening divine spiritual voice, the two nephews fell to the ground,  but as soon as they had come to, they took their weapons to Boaz saying: 
“The Creator has spared you, Boaz, for the death of your father. We are now the most  guilty before the Eternal since we willingly conceived to carry out upon you our vindictive  thought.” 
Boaz answered his two nephews: “May the will of the Creator be done!” 
After this acceptance from Boaz, they all went back to the city of Enoch. The gloom and  despondency which showed upon their faces brought Cain’s kin great consternation. This  pain increased even more when this generation learned that the death of their father Cain  was committed by the last-born of this same father. 
Poor Boaz, having been crushed by a general enmity from Cain’s first generation and  their descendants, was forced to withdraw from this mob of possessed diabolical intellects, 
46 
and took refuge in the desert of Jezanias, which means “listen to the Creator.” Here Boaz  ended his days in penance and contrition. 
This then is the classical example of prophecy, as shown when he said after the crime  that he had committed against his brother Abel: “Those who will meet me, Lord, will kill  me.” Wasn’t he met by his son in the thicket? Wasn’t he, in fact, killed by a man, as he had  said? What really gives rise to the idea of prophecy is that the meeting of Cain and Boaz  was not premeditated, and both met in a place where Cain received the fatal blow without  recognizing each other. 
77 
An Error of Men of Our Times on the Last Patricide 
I want to bring to your attention to how ridiculous and absurd the observation is that  men of our times make about Cain’s patricide by his son Boaz. This type, unknown to the  greatest part of men today, confirms their belief and even assures them that Adam was not  the first man because, they say, when Cain killed his brother Abel, he said to the Creator,  “Lord, what will become of me? Those who will meet me will kill me.” If these men had  been instructed about the one who uttered these words to the Creator, they would have  clearly understood that they were words of a prophet and of prophecies to come, as we have  already seen happen among men on Earth and to Cain himself. 
But, you may say, how could the Creator send prophets to men so as to limit their  actions which are contrary to the laws that He had given them, when you say that the  Creator takes no part in secondary causes? I will answer that the Creator is aware of the  demoniacal thinking being who continually carries out seductive and pernicious acts for  the spiritual minor, just as it had already taken place in the seduction of Adam and his  generation. Consequently, the Creator judged it necessary, for the benefit of man, to elect  spiritually minor beings and to endow them with the prophetic spirit, not only to contain  man within the laws, precepts, and commands that He had given them, but also for the  greatest molestation of evil spirits and for the manifestation of His greatest divine glory.  The Eternal becomes aware of secondary causes by the good and bad thoughts and actions  of a spiritual being before the Creator. 
78 
Retreat of Boaz into the Desert of Jezanias 
Let us now see what type of retreat Boaz’s flight into the desert of Jezanias represents.  Boaz, being the last son of Cain’s immediate generation, completes the denary number by  his rank. There is no doubt that he was endowed with spiritually divine gifts to be an image  and a real example of the great mercy that the Creator grants, in whatever circumstance,  whether for the benefit of the spiritual minor being or for the benefit of the perverse major, 
47 
when spirits sincerely call upon Him. You should understand very clearly the grace that the  Creator granted Boaz, who was doubly criminal; firstly for having assisted in the worship  to the demons rather than to the Creator and having a perfect knowledge of both, and  secondly for having allowed himself to be led by false habit and example, which had been  acquired among Cain’s generation, either through fear of pain that this generation would  make him suffer, or for his own personal satisfaction. 
Secondly, Boaz was a criminal for having put his father Cain to death, and having  contravened what the Creator forbade and about which He warned Cain’s posterity after  what happened to Abel. It is not that the Creator, for that matter, foresees the future conduct  of the secondary causes which would operate among this generation (you know what I  have said about this), but it was to warn the princes of demons by this prohibition that He  knew about their atrocious behavior and wanted to warn men of the abominations that the  demons could exercise against them as they had already done for the fall of Adam and of his  first generation. Have men themselves not always judged the future conduct of their peers  by past conduct, in spite of the misleading saying that a man cannot answer for himself or  his future conduct? Don’t we know that the Creator is stronger and more powerful than  the demons, and that their greatest diabolic rage can only attract more curses when raised  against the Creator or the righteous minor whose fabric is unshakable when built on the  slightest divine spiritual basis? And lastly, don’t we know that whatever the Lord watches is  well guarded? It was upon this sole invincible power and immutable justice of the Creator  that all edicts and threats to Cain’s posterity were made by Him. 
79 
Why the Demons Attack the Bodies of Men Rather than Those of Beasts 
I would like to make a short digression by going back to what I have just told you, so that  you can better understand the atrocious conduct that the demoniac spirits prefer to enact  against the form of the minor and the minor itself. The diabolic spirits attach themselves  to the form of the minor rather than that of the brute, because the form of man is the image  and general copy of the Creator’s great work. Man bears upon his form the real image of  the apparent form which appeared in the Creator’s imagination, and which was then put  into apparently solid and passive material substance by divine spiritual workers for the  formation of the universal, general, and particular temple. 
Those spirits attach themselves even more willingly to man’s form, because it contains  the minor spiritual being who is more powerful, and which they continually try to seduce  and tum away from the Creator. This is why the prince of demons, through his intellectual  spirits, gets them to attack the bodily form of man rather than beasts, because animals are  not an image of the Creator’s great work and they have no divine spiritual being on which  demoniac spirits can make some impression. It should be remembered that the demoniac  spirit, which always seeks to persecute minors, starts by attacking their form through the 
48 
bad intellect. When it completely joins with this form, the bad intellect makes the passive  life of man susceptible to becoming demoniac spiritual life. 
Then from there, this spiritual intellect attacks the spiritually divine minor so that it can  receive the impressions of the prince of demons, which have been ordered and sworn to  wage combat against every kind of spiritual activity given to the glory of the Creator. From  this fearsome combat comes the good or bad reintegration of the corporeal form and minor  being. Everything depends on the steadfastness of the minor to reject this foreign being  from its form, or on its weakness to give in to the insinuations of the bad spirit. 
It is easy to convince ourselves that these kinds of combat happen on the form of man  rather than on those of beasts. Let us then observe the actions, movements, and operation of  these animals. Do they have the combinations and thoughts to destroy or to preserve their  corporeal form? Do they worship? Do they have the laws to manage their behavior? Don’t  we see, on the contrary, that everything operates among them according to pure nature  which looks after them only during their temporal life? But the actions of the minor – its  movements, its operations – show themselves in an entirely opposite manner to those of the  beasts, and the difference between the two is so marked that it is impossible to deny. Yes,  what comes from the rational animal is always above what comes from the irrational, and  this is because man’s corporeal form contains three kinds of life, which I will make clearer. 
80 
Three Sorts of Life in Man: Passive, Demoniacal, and Divine 
The first is the life of matter, which we call instinct or passive life, and which is innate  in the form of the rational animal as well as the irrational. The second is the demoniacal  spiritual life, which can incorporate itself into the passive life, and the third is the divine  spiritual life, which presides over the first two. You will not find the same thing among  beasts; they have only a being of passive life issued from the divine spiritual operation  of the central fiery axis, which daily directs its action upon all forms of apparent matter  consolidated by this same operation. It is by this action and operation that all forms of  apparent matter are maintained during the course of their fixed temporal life by the will of  the Creator. 
Such is the difference which remains between rational and irrational beings, and the  reason that the demoniacal operations attack the corporeal forms of man rather than those  of beasts. A mediator is not necessary for these beasts to put them back within the domain  of their natural laws when their pure and simple passion makes them stray from these laws  made by their movement. They do not need this mediator because their dissensions do not  come from an outside agent other than what nature dictates. This is the digression that I  intended to make. I wanted to explain to you the example of Boaz’s retreat into the desert  of Jezanias, and it offered me an opportunity to instruct you about the most essential things  that are of greatest consequence for the man of desire.
49 
81 
Man Is Freed Before the Demons 
It is by Boaz’s retreat that we should understand that it is within the power of the  spiritually divine minor to separate himself when he wishes from the possession and the  connection that he has established with the prince of demons through the diabolic intellect.  I will not enter here into the details of the different types which Cain’s posterity represent  because I will do so later. However, I should give you an explanation again of Abel’s birth,  just as I can give you some examples of a similar kind when the opportunity arises. 
82 
Types of Abel 
I will tell you, therefore, that Adam and Eve cooperated to form their son Abel by a  very succinct material operation; that is to say, without the excessive participation of their  material senses. And so they completely submitted themselves to the Creator through a  perfect and spiritual surrender. The Creator could not refuse to connect with their operation  by composing within their produced form a minor being endowed with virtue and divine  spiritual wisdom. This spiritual being was to be a type of the manifestation of divine justice  for the benefit of the minors and to the shame of the demons, as he was to be the principal  instrument of Adam’s and Eve’s reconciliation. The type that Abel personified, on account  of all of Adam’s generation until the end of time, was not the only spiritual image that this  minor being represented; he served as still another example for the general and particular  benefit of every spiritual being. Moreover, Abel is a true example of minors endowed with  divine grace which the Creator brings among men to be the spiritual instruments of His  justice, either for the reward or for the punishment of his creatures, according to whether  their works conform to divine law or not. 
IV. ENOCH 
83 
Enoch, an Example of the Divine Spirit and Its Action 
Among the minors destined for these kinds of spiritual operations, we shall first consider  Enoch, the seventh of his generation who replaced Abel, namely the generation of Seth. He  is by rank of birth a true example of the divine spirit for the support, conduct, and defense  of the minors against persecution by the demons. By the mission, work, and worship that  he professed, he is also an example of the true type of direct action of the doubly powerful  spirit which, at that time, laid down for men the conduct necessary to protect them from  attacks by their enemies. This same conduct was to guide them in their natural temporal  and spiritual operations, and to serve as a fundamental basis in the rituals of their worship  conforming to divinity.

An Examination of the Worship Practiced by Enoch 
Let us examine, therefore, what worship Enoch practiced among the descendants of  Seth. He was the first to build an altar of white stone that is different from what we call  marble. Enoch received the fruit of his worship on the center of this altar and where he  offered himself in sacrifice. Enoch was the first to teach the spiritual minors to erect divine  structures. It was he who prophesied the justice of the Creator to be fulfilled upon the  face of the Earth in punishment of the crimes of Cain’s generations and the remainder of  Seth’s generation, who joined with those of Cain. He determined the covenant of Seth’s  generation by forbidding the divine Creator’s children to form liaisons with the children of  men. (By what I have said about Adam’s transgression and its results, you will understand  what I mean by the children of men.) It was Enoch who prophesied that the Creator’s truly  elected were to be born from the Eternal by electing ten individuals to promote the divine  cult among Seth’s generation. Enoch was therefore the classical example of devotion and  ceremony of the past, just as he still is for people of the present, which will be better  understood by an explanation of his spiritual divine operations. 
Enoch, who was simply a holy spirit in a corporeal form of apparent matter, held a  divine spiritual assembly in the northern region, in accordance with the wish and goodwill  of his disciples chosen from Seth’s and Enoch’s descendants. This generation he called the  children of the Creator and, struck by the force of Enoch’s sacred operations, they could not  avoid calling him Enoch, the holy man, a name which means dedicated or devoted to the  Creator. With overwhelming success, he reformed the conduct of the minors, who already  recognized him as a powerful man over every created thing. He questioned them on all of  the various daily actions and invocations that they practiced contrary to the Creator’s will,  and which barely qualified them to be the so-called children of the living God. The lessons  taught them on this subject, and even the threats that he made about the terrible events  which could happen at any time, caused the minors to adopt fully his code of conduct,  discipline, and instructions. Enoch reassured and strengthened their faith in and practice of  his sacred operations which they as yet understood only through the discourse that he had  held on the first meeting on the day of the Sabbath. 
Consequently, he organized an election from among them of ten persons to whom he  declared the Creator’s will and set out a ceremony and code of life so that the Eternal  could be invoked in sacredness. He admitted these ten subjects to the knowledge of the  chaotic listic works (these two words, which belong to the divine spiritual sciences, shall  be explained later). He then made them erect a building of only one room in which he  and his ten chosen met to assist him in the sacred work. He gave each of them the first  letter of the holy names of God, which made ten letters in all, allowing them to practice  with regularity and exactness all kinds of operations favorable to the Creator and to the 
51 
advantage of the reconciled minors. After this first act, he sent them back to their allocated  tents, just as Moses had demonstrated by the encampment of the Levites around the Ark. 
Every tenth week, Enoch held this meeting of divine work with his ten elect, and at  each meeting, he gave them a new letter of the sacred name of God, so that after seven  gatherings, each had two powerful words by which to command all created things from the  terrestrial to the celestial planes. These two words consisted of seven letters, four of which  formed the awesome, invincible, and powerful name of the Eternal, which governed and  subjected every created being in the celestial realm, and the remaining three formed a holy  name which subjected and ruled every created being in the earthly realm. These ten chiefs,  their virtues and spiritual divine powers restored by Enoch, performed such wondrous  sacred works that they converted several members of their family. They instructed minors  truly called by the Holy Spirit in the sciences that they possessed through the power and  ministry of Enoch, who was an example of the reconciliation of human kind. 
85 
Revolt of the Sixth Disciple of Enoch 
In a short time, the number of converts became quite considerable, but these new converts  did not maintain their virtues and powers. What perverted several of them was the atrocious  conduct of one of their ten leaders admitted by Enoch to divine reconciliation and who  provoked dissension amongst the others to spread mistrust about Enoch’s teachings. This  spirit of revolt increased so much among the newly called that they eventually abandoned  the Creator entirely to the delight of matter and to the chief transgressor, and so no more  than nine righteous men remained on Earth. These nine called upon their strength and  knowledge that they had received from the holy Enoch, and begged him to meet with them  again to replace one of their brothers that the demon had taken away. 
Enoch, receptive to their prayers, met with these nine to whom he communicated the  entire secret. At this meeting, he elected the one to replace the transgressor, adding that the  one chosen would enter into virtue and power only after they themselves had atoned for  their sins, and when the divine justice had purged the criminals. The hearts of these nine  righteous were so stunned that they remained in a kind of stupor or drowsiness which lasted  about an hour. During this time, Enoch made his invocation to the Creator on behalf of the  nine disciples who then saw all of the plagues that the Creator would summon to strike  the earth and its inhabitants. The terror that they experienced brought them out of their  despondency. They uttered a great cry at Enoch and said to him: 
“How is it, Master, that everything that we have just seen must happen on this earth?  Could you not calm by your prayers the wrath of the One who sent you among us and hold  back the scourges that He proposes to launch upon the earth and its inhabitants? The vision  that we have had is not false; the Creator is just, and you are holy, strong, and invincible.”
52 
Enoch replied, “Who has thus instructed you about me? Be all one man, and you will  be equally holy. Be all under the same law, and you will be strong. Be all under the same  code of life which I have prescribed for you, and you will be eternal invincible minors.  Such is the will of the Father and of the Holy Spirit upon his son. Always be the son of  the Almighty here below, and you will know that the one named Enoch is the spirit of the  Father who is above.” 
86 
Enoch Taken to Heaven 
Enoch had scarcely finished speaking and blessing the nine disciples when a fiery  cloud descended from Heaven and quickly raised him to carry this Holy Spirit away to his  destination. His disciples, who had lost sight of him, lamented and said, “What is to become  of us, O Eternal, without the help of our master Enoch? Why do you take him from his  brothers and his disciples? If the earth is culpable, why are we corporeal men responsible if  it is material blood only which we have received from the earth and which we leave to Thy  holy justice? Grant, Lord, our wishes and have pity on Thy sons and servants.” 
87 
Noah Takes Up Enoch’s Religion Again 
Soon afterwards, Enoch was to be a new type, following the will of the Creator, just as  we have seen several successive examples from times immemorial until today. The first  principle of divine spiritual religion that he had established among Seth’s posterity was  preserved and reactivated by the vigor and power of Noah, who is yet another example  of the spiritually elect for general and particular reconciliation. We will clearly see this  when we examine his entering the Ark with the different kinds of animals, the tranquility  and security of the Ark during the flood, the spiritual instructions that Noah gave to his  legitimate sons, and finally his conduct safeguarding all those who had been entrusted  to him against the terrible curse that God sent to exterminate the earth and all its other  inhabitants. 
88 
The Duty of the Messiah and the 70 Years of Servitude 
Without examining the detail regarding Enoch’s special conduct towards his disciples  and his secretly elected, it is enough to note that what has just been said is sufficient to  clearly see that the true Messiah has always been with God’s children but unknown most of  the time. We shall also find with this same explanation the interpretation of what the prophet  Daniel meant in one of his prophecies when he spoke symbolically of the captivity of Israel  for 70 weeks, converted to 70 years under Nebuchadnezzar, a prophecy confirmed by the  bondage of the Israelites and from which they were delivered by the powerful actions of 
53 
Zerubbabel after 70 years of servitude to which the Creator had condemned them for the  errors that they had committed against God and their brothers. 
89 
The Ten Types of Messiahs 
But it is not only with the advent of Enoch, which I just started to explain, that we find  proof of the presence of the Christ among God’s children. Abel, who was an example of  an appointed minor for the manifestation of His divine justice, also represented a true  kind of Messiah. We recognize this truth by the action of all elected minors who exercised  their power and spiritual virtue among the people of centuries past and who still operate  today. The elected minors since Abel and Enoch are Noah, Melchizedek, Joseph, Moses,  David, Solomon, Zerubbabel, and the Messiah. All of these subjects, appointed for the  manifestation of divine glory, make up the complete divine spiritual denary number from  which all material and spiritual things have arisen, as I will explain shortly when discussing  the types and epochs that the general and particular body, as well as the minors, have  experienced. In effect, with these explanations, you will be able to convince yourselves  of the truth of what I have said, by the similarity and connection that these minors’ works  have with Abel’s works; this will allow you to recognize clearly that Abel was a true  representation of the Christ just as Cain truly represented the operations of the prince of  demons. 
90 
The Abominations Represented by Cain’s Crime 
By the murder of his brother Abel, Cain, in effect, represents the rage of the demons  who had sworn to dissolve and to destroy any form of creation, and that by making use  of men, in whom they insinuate and suggest a multitude of material passions, which they  know reflect the weak elements of their material and spiritual life, they set minors against  one another and keep them in confusion. We also see that among men of matter, no two  thoughts, two actions, or two operations agree. The determination of the demons to sow  dissension only leads men to give rise to immodest thoughts of pride and ambition, so  that they continually live in divine spiritual discord, which keeps them in ignorance of  their corporeal and spiritual origins, and ignorant of the motive and cause of their trouble  and pain to which they are condemned. Eventually, they lose completely the idea of the  devotion that they ought to show towards the Creator. 
91 
The Expulsion of Adam and the Incarnation of the Christ 
Here then are the abominations shown to us by Cain’s crimes. Abel was truly his earthly  brother, both having emanated from the same man, but there is no comparison between 
54 
the corporeal formation of either one. The corporeal form of Cain was conceived through  excessive voluptuous pleasure, and it traces for us the transgression of the first man. Abel,  on the other hand, was conceived without the excesses of the material senses but instead  by the purity of the laws of nature. Moreover, his form was more spiritual than material  and it is by this spiritual conception that we see Abel’s form as a true representation of  the Christ’s form, issued spiritually from an ordinary woman without the assistance of  physical action or the involvement of the material senses. On the other hand, this corporeal  formation of the Christ recounts the story of the first man who, after his transgression, was  stripped of his glorious body and in turn given one of gross matter while throwing himself  into the depths of the earth. This doubly powerful divine spirit, superior to every emanated  being, lived in a pure and glorious circle of divine immensity before he came to operate  the divine justice among men. But when sent by the Creator, he left this spiritual abode to  enter the womb of a virgin girl. 
Now, does the relinquishment of his true home, which the minor Christ made, not  remind us of the expulsion of the first man from his glorious body? Does not the entering  of this spiritual major or word of the Creator into the body of a virgin, remind us clearly  of the entering of the first minor into the earth’s abyss to cloth itself in a body of matter?  The different pains and upheavals that this virgin’s body experienced in pregnancy and  childbirth represent the demoniacal spiritual subjection and upheavals that the general  earthly body endured and must endure in proportion to Adam’s transgression. With God  having then cursed the earth and having delivered His harsh punishments, the persecutions  that the various nations directed towards the virgin’s body and its fruit represent what  the various demons have done and are doing to the general and particular body of Earth,  including its minors. 
The defeat of the body of Christ, destroyed by the hands of men, also proves that the  demons have power over the corporeal forms of apparent matter, but we should be aware  that these demons cannot prevent the reintegration of spirituous substances which have not  come from them. They can also destroy the particular form but not the general earthly form  which can come to an end only at a time determined by the Creator. The destruction of the  Christ as a physical individual, carried out by men in the presence of two women (Mary  Magdalene and Mary of Zebedee) was represented by Cain’s murder of his brother Abel  in the presence of his two sisters. The two women that I have just mentioned followed the  Christ in all his divine spiritual work, just as Cain’s two sisters followed their brother in his  demoniacal work. 
92 
The Blood of Christ Foreshadowed by That of Abel and of Abraham 
These are not the only correspondences that we can recognize between the operations of  the Christ and those of the first minors. We cannot ignore that the blood which flowed from 
55 
the body of the righteous Abel has a certain resemblance to the blood that the Christ had to  spill and effectively did spill. The blood spilled by Abel on Earth was a genuine example  and reality of the action of divine grace which brings peace and mercy on Earth and to its  inhabitants. It was also the type of covenant that the Creator made with His creature after  his reconciliation, just as we saw the first man return the Creator’s grace immediately after  Abel’s sacrifice. Was this not repeated clearly by Abraham’s circumcision, by which the  father of many obtained his perfect reconciliation with the Creator, and was it not by the  shedding of his blood that the patriarch realized the covenant that the Eternal made with  him? Is it not therefore understandable that the shedding of Christ’s blood is a confirmation  of all those types who have gone before Him, since this bloodshed, causing an earthquake,  made His reconciliation and the covenant that the Creator made with the earth and its  inhabitants felt throughout the whole of nature? 
93 
The Sun Eclipsed by the Christ’s Death, as It Will Be at the End of Time 
Seeing that I started to speak to you of the events which accompanied the operations of  the Christ, explaining to you the earthquake which then occurred, you may well wonder why  the sun darkened at the same time. I will tell you that the eclipse in the celestial region is a  real example of the scourge from the demoniacal spirits, whom the Christ, by his operation,  reduced more considerably than they were in their privation of power against particular  and general creation. This eclipse recalls to mind, moreover, the shadows of ignorance  into which the Hebrews were plunged when they had eclipsed from their memory the holy  divine names which had previously guided them in all their natural, temporal, and divine  spiritual works. It also represented the blindness of the incredulous ones that are and will  remain deprived of the divine light until the end of time. 
Lastly, this eclipse was the true example of general matter which will entirely disappear  at the end of time and fade from the presence of man like a painting fades from the  imagination of a painter. By this last comparison you will be able to understand that the  principle of matter of the general body is none other than a spiritual picture that the Creator  had conceived in his imagination, and hence in this spiritual picture was included every  corporeal being but all the while without material substance. This picture mainly contained  the minor spiritual who was to contribute to the formation of bodies. 
94 
The Veil of the Temple Torn Away: An Example of the Destiny of the Hebrews 
As I have explained the important eclipse at the time of the death of the Christ, you  may ask that I also explain the significance of the tearing of the veil, which happened at the  same time. In the hope that it will be useful to you, I shall agree to do so. I will tell you that  the tearing of the veil of the Temple is a significant benefit for the spiritual minor who will 
56 
have the fortune of being included in the ranks of those whom the Creator will reward with  His most spiritual divine glory. 
The torn veil is the true example of deliverance of the minor deprived of the Creator’s  presence. It explains the reintegration of apparent matter, which veils and separates every  minor being from perfect knowledge and from all of the significant works that the Creator  carries out every moment for His greatest glory. It explains the tearing and descent of the  seven planetary heavens which, because of their material bodies, veil spiritual minors from  the great divine light which reigns beyond the celestial. It explains, moreover, the rupture  of that which, for the most part, hid and veiled the knowledge of the Creator’s works  carried out for His greatest justice for the benefit of His creature. 
Moses’s example leads us to understand clearly this latter image, in giving the Hebrews  knowledge of the divine law, which he recited to them with his face covered in a red veil.  This red veil, which hid Moses’s face from the people and the tables on which the intentions  and will of the Creator were written, represented, in a perfect way, the perverse spirits  who are a scandalous veil to all minors associated with them. The red color of the veil  represents the demoniacal intellect’s insinuation of the minor’s principal senses, depriving  him of every communication with the divine spiritual senses and making him incapable  of retaining any spiritual impression whatsoever, whether common, mysterious, or even  spiritually pure and simple in kind. Moses’s veiled face indicated the spiritual ignorance  into which the Israelites were going to fall and the state of privation of divine knowledge  into which Moses could see that they were going to be reduced by the covenant that they  were going to make with the prince of demons. 
It is because of these criminal covenants that the Hebrews were called children of  darkness and children of the blood of matter, and replaced by the children of divine grace.  But these new children should be careful not to become complacent about the grace that  they have at the expense of the Hebrew people, whose reprobation is a striking example of  the reality which the whole world will have to face one day, and about which I will speak  more when explaining the last upheavals which will occur at the end of time. 
95 
Seth, Abel’s Heir 
I have spoken extensively enough about Cain and Abel that I will now pass on to Adam’s  posterity. I have shown how Adam had been perfectly reconciled through Abel. You will  readily understand that, without this reconciliation, universal, general, and particular nature  would not exist in the same way as it does today, even though the length of its duration  would have been the same. But as the Creator had given Abel all the necessary gifts during  his life to bring about the manifestation of divine glory for the benefit of creation and to  the shame of the demons, it was vital that after his death these gifts be passed on to another 
57 
minor. The decrees of the Creator have been implemented and will always be implemented  with irrevocable immutability. 
Adam therefore conceived, with the Creator’s sanction, a third descendant, whom  he named Seth, which means “admitted to God’s posterity.” This spiritual minor being  inherited all of the powerful gifts that Abel possessed. Moreover, these gifts transmitted to  Seth had much more spiritual power and activity than when Abel had them because Abel  was only ever to be a simple type of spiritual reconciliation, whereas Seth had not only this  to bear, but also the stability of the laws of nature, the course of various cyclic upheavals,  and temporal events which were to take place among his people the moment that they  removed from their gaze He who created this in His divine imagination.  
96 
Seth Instructed in Numbers by Hely 
To this end, the Creator Himself, through His spiritual envoy named Hely, instructed  the blessed Seth in the secret spiritual divine forces which contain and direct all of nature,  whether spiritual or material. Through the spirit, he received directly from the Creator  everything that there was to know about the Eternal’s immutable laws, and he learned that  every law of temporal creation and every divine action was based upon different numbers.  From Hely, he learned that every number was coeternal with the Creator, and that by these  various numbers, the Creator formed every image, every convention of creation, and formed  His creature. So that you may not doubt this truth, I shall give you the knowledge of these  coeternal numbers which are innate in the Creator. 
97 
Superiority of the Denary Number, First Divine Power 
You undoubtedly know that sages, past and present, have always regarded the denary  number as a respectable number in every sense. They had and still have so much respect  for this number only because they learned to know its force through perseverance in their  divine spiritual work, and by this means obtained the same gifts which had been entrusted  to Seth. These sages did not obtain these gifts for their physical descendants, most of whom  never had any, even though they had union with female minors according to the Creator’s  will, but they used these gifts only for the education of spiritual children that the Creator  assigned to them and to prepare them to become instruments of the manifestation of divine  glory. Knowledge of the famous denary number was perpetuated among this spiritual  posterity, a number which contained all kinds of numbers of creation, and from which they  had the ability to derive all of the terrestrial, minor, major, and superior numbers innate  within it, just as Seth had been taught and as has been told to me in order to instruct the  man of desire.
58 
I shall teach you, therefore, as I understand it from those who were given the responsibility  to teach me, that the denary number contains the four numbers of divine power. I place  before you the denary number in four different illustrations of an arithmetical character: 1,  2, 3, and 4. Add these four figures in the following manner: 1 and 2 make 3, 3 and 3 make  6, and 6 and 4 make 10. You will find your denary number which is the great and divine  power in which the other three are contained, as you can see by the following addition: 3  and 4 produce the number 7, which is the second power of the Creator; 1 and 2 make 3, and  3 and 3 make 6, which is the third power of the Creator; finally, add 1 and 3, and you have  4, which is the quaternary number that ends and concludes the four divine powers of the  Creator contained in His coeternal denary number. 
98 
One, Two, Three, Four, and Ten 
To clarify your understanding, it is best that I give you the application of these four  numbers so that you know to what use each was put by the Creator for His universal, general,  and particular creation. I shall tell you then that the denary number is indivisible, or that  which cannot take any division. It is the number which completes, divides, and subdivides  every kind of number within the spiritual divine, corporeal and animal, universal, general,  and particular temples. This is why this well-known number has always been regarded by the  sages as a unique number and representing the quadruple divine essence and, consequently,  highly respected by every spiritual being who has come from this number. This is also why  the number can be operated only by the Creator and not by any doubly powerful, simple  and minor, spiritual being, and no sage makes use of this number through respect, always  leaving this to Divinity. Here then is the use of the denary number, or the first divine power,  written thus: 10 or ①, and by this number the divine-thinking imagination conceived divine  temporal spiritual creation. Let us pass on to the septenary number. 
99 
The Septenary Emanates from the Denary, the Second Divine Power 
The septenary number, which came from the absolute denary number, is the more-than perfect number that the Creator used for the emancipation of every spirit outside His divine  immensity. The category of septenary spirits was to serve as the first agent and positive  cause to contribute in the operation of every kind of movement in forms created in the  universal circle. What do we observe in all of these forms? Resonance, movement, action,  and reaction. All of the various qualities and properties of these forms would not make an  impression upon us if they had not within them an innate being, which we call the particle  of the central axis of uncreated fire, making them susceptible to all of the actions that we  observe in them. But all of these actions and movements of material forms cannot be due  to this sole innate principle, and this principle, or particle of uncreated fire, would never 
59 
produce any effect in corporeal forms if it were not activated by a principal and superior  cause which gives it its own movement and maintains the form itself. 
This superior cause, as we see, is none other than these divine spiritual septenary agents  who preside like chiefs over the different actions and movements of all bodies to which it  transmits its thoughts and will as they conceived it. This has, in fact, been demonstrated to  us by what was said previously, that the human corporeal form was the organ of the soul  – or the minor – and one cannot better conceive the faculties and power of these septenary  agents upon corporeal beings than by the different operations that the minors produce on  their own forms seen by others of their kind. This then is the virtue and powerful faculty of  the septenary number, its emanation from the denary number, and the use that the Creator  made of it for the emancipation of spirits formed in His image; this number is the second  power of Divinity. 
100 
The Senary Also Emanates from the Denary, Third Divine Power 
The third divine power, or the senary, is likewise a number emanated from the famous  denary number. The number six is not as perfect or as powerful in spiritual virtue as the  septenary number, and this is because the senary number can be divided into two equal  parts, or two times three, which cannot be done to the number seven without destroying  it and changing its nature. The senary number is the one by which the Creator manifested  from His thought every image of apparent corporeal forms within the universal circle.  Does not Genesis teach that God created everything in six days? This is not to suggest that  Genesis wanted to limit the power of Divinity by restricting it in time, be it six days or six  years. The Creator is a pure spirit superior to time, but He could have operated six divine  thoughts for universal creation, and this number six does effectively belong to the creation  of every form of apparent matter. By this same number, the Creator gave His creature,  whether spiritual or corporeal, a sense of time which will remain in universal creation. 
This, then, is the virtue of the number six and the use that the Creator made of it. In this  way, the sages have acquired the knowledge of the principle of the forms and limits that the  Creator has placed upon their temporal and passive existence. Moreover, we learn from this  that every corporeal being will reintegrate itself into its first principle of emanation by the  same number which produced it. Let us move on to the quaternary number, or the fourth  power of the Creator. 
101 
The Quaternary Completes the Quadruple Divine Essence 
The quaternary number, which completes the quadruple divine essence, is infinitely  more perfect and significant than the number six, because it is the number which contributes 
60 
to the perfection of the forms taken from indifferent matter, since it gives movement and  action to corporeal form and presides over every created being as the principal number  from which all has come. We also call it the number of the powerful word of the Creator,  as containing within it all kinds of numbers of earthly, spiritual, and divine creation, as I  explained to you by the various additions of the four figures which make up this quaternary  number and by the adding up of these same figures to make the number ten. 
By these different additions, the various faculties and powers that man received from  the Creator were designated. That is why it is in the quaternary number that man must  come to know all of the numbers of spiritual powers innate within him, because he had  the misfortune of being deprived of this knowledge. The quaternary number is, in effect,  the one that the Creator used for the emanation and the emancipation of man, or spiritual  minor, which means that the soul is called eternal or impassive life, as I shall point out to  you. 
102 
The Ternary, Type of Three Spirituous Essences 
You should know that the triangular figure has always been regarded as very important  among the sages of various nations. Adam, Enoch, Moses, Solomon, and the Christ all  made great use of this figure in their works. We see that even today this triangle is placed  upon our altars and on the top of or on the frontispiece of buildings. I wonder if this figure  could be the fruit of the builder’s imagination. This cannot be possible since it existed  before him and is within the nature of our own body. Nor can we believe that the triangle is  the figure of the Trinity, even though we give the angles of an equilateral triangle the names  of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit because, after all, Divinity cannot be represented  by any perceptible form to material eyes. This figure, therefore, represents nothing other  than the three spirituous essences which have cooperated in the general terrestrial form,  and is shown thus: 
▽ 
The lower point represents mercury, the southern angle represents sulphur, and the  northern one salt. Now, it is only the joining of the spiritual principle, or the quaternary  number, to these three essences which has given them an intimate liaison and given them  the one single figure and form, which truly represents the general terrestrial body divided  into three parts: West, North and South. By the joining of the number 1 with the number 3,  we demonstrate the great power of the number 4, which perfectly completes the quadruple  divine essence. The three angular points emanate from the center of this triangle. This  center is composed of four letters. We shall see very clearly that every being of creation is  subject to and comes from the quadruple divine essence, and that the minor spirit, by its  quatemal emanation, truly bears this number of quadruple essence.
61 
103 
Seth, Equal to Primitive Adam 
These are the sublime spiritual instructions that Seth received from the Creator by  way of His representative Hely. He acquired complete power and knowledge of divine  operations, and he was not, as has been said, instructed in all of the spiritual and the natural  sciences by his father Adam. That was not possible since Adam, by his transgression, was  stripped of all spiritual power, and, after his reconciliation, he obtained but one simple  minor power which he could transmit only by the supreme authority of Divinity. Adam  could only communicate to Seth the difficult ceremonial obtained through long work of  body, soul and spirit, and never the spiritual fruits issued from his spiritual temporal works. 
Adam, in his first state of justice, as I have outlined to you, truly received from the  divine spirit all of the sciences and spiritual knowledge – that is, the sure path and exact  plan of every divine spiritual operation for which he had been emanated – but having made  criminal use of his powers, the Creator withdrew them immediately and left poor Adam,  even after his reconciliation, prone to making mistakes in all of his human, spiritual, and  temporal works, which happens to man every time he operates only by virtue of the three  ternary powers which are airy, earthly, and fiery powers. 
It is very dangerous for the man of desire to use these three powers in any operation  without first having obtained from the Creator the quaternary power withdrawn from us by  Adam’s transgression, and the lack of this quaternary power makes us feel that man, since  Adam’s transgression, is a man of error, and that man is truly in divine spiritual privation.  It is true that He can sometimes come out of this privation during his temporal existence,  but never for long. The Creator, who is immutable, expressly said to his reconciled that  no knowledge of divine science would be given back to him until after he had earned it  through the works prescribed for him for the second time, because since that time, man has  been ignorant and narrow-minded which would not have happened if he had directed his  quaternary powers according to the Creator’s will. 
104 
Seth, Also an Example of Divine Mercy 
Besides the convincing types that Seth represents in spiritual reconciliation and the  consolidation of natural laws, he also represents real divine mercy because he replaced  Abel, and, because he prayed for the grace of his brother Cain, appears to have gained it,  either by the atonement that Cain made for his crime by the kind of death which struck him,  or by the penance that Boaz made for the unintentional murder of Cain. You should be in  no doubt that the two minors received the Creator’s mercy by the virtue and sanctity of the  blessed Seth. If you were to ask what certain physical proof could be offered to convince  you of what I say on this subject, I shall answer by saying that when you have the good 
62 
fortune of knowing the nature of Seth’s work, or that which wise men, such as Moses or  the Christ, carried out after him, you will not ask those kinds of questions any more. If you  had been in the company of these famous wise men, you would mind your questions. You  would be happy to admire their works without seeking to understand what they said, for  it would have been more difficult to understand their questions and discourse than their  deeds, which were carried out plainly before those who were present.

Seth Instructs His Son Enos in Divine Practice 
Honorable Seth, descendant of God by birth, was responsible for instructing his  descendants in the divine practice. He transmitted to his son Enos (which means “weak  mortal”), every ceremonial of divine, spiritual, earthly, celestial, watery, and fiery operation.  He warned him upon the threat of the most terrible suffering to not abuse the Eternal’s  knowledge that he had confided in him, as well as the fruits resulting from his spiritual  works. He forbade, among other things, any liaison with the profane, or the children of men  – that is, the concubine girls of Cain’s descendants – and that this race could never have  union with the children of God who were Seth’s posterity. 
106 
Seth’s and Enos’ Posterity Perverted until Enoch 
It was in this posterity that the Creator was to give birth to the minors appointed for  the manifestation of His glory, as I have already pointed out to you by the few words said  about the election of Enoch and what I will make more understandable by listing all those  minors elected. You will see that it did not take long for Seth’s posterity, and that of his son  Enos, to be corrupted through marriage with Cain’s descendants and thus forfeit all divine  spiritual knowledge that Seth had taught. Enos’ descendants remained in abomination until  the seventh generation, from which came the patriarch Enoch, of whom I have already  spoken, and with whom I am going to deal extensively now. This is all that I have to say of  interest on the nature of Seth, believing that it is not necessary to enter into the details of  specific events which are not useful for the things that you wish to know. 
107 
Enoch, or Dedication, Son of Jared 
Enoch was from Seth’s descendants and his father was Jared, which means “man  illuminated by God.” The father gave his son the name Eliacim, which signified resurrection  of the Lord in Seth’s posterity, and he surnamed Enoch with an E instead of an H. This name  means “dedication.” All of these names and the type represented by Jared in Seth’s and  Enos’ posterity were true images of the past, present, and future. Jared was a righteous man  before the Creator, and more powerful in divine virtue than all other patriarchs, because 
63 
of the force of divine practice that he exercised for the atonement of the crimes of Enos’  descendants. The light that he received daily from the divine spirit prepared him to be the  forerunner of a righteous being that he knew was to emanate from him. This same spirit  informed him of the marvelous character that his son Enoch was to become by the divine  spirit and action of Divinity, for the conduct and defense of the minors against the attack  of their enemies, as we have already said previously when speaking of Enoch’s election.  Jared learned through the spirit that his son Enoch was to operate and has, in fact, operated  among Cain’s and Seth’s descendants and the female descendants of Adam, which together  form the three nations inhabiting the earth. 
108 
Tripartition of Universal Creation and Tripartition of the World 
I shall not pass over this last matter without pointing out to you that the general  convention is to distinguish four nations on Earth – namely, Ishmael, Israel, the Christians,  and the idolatrous or unbelievers, who, under the pretext of honoring and raising Divinity,  do not recognize any other God than matter. But as soon as this division into four parts is  made by men without the divine aspect, it can only be false and erroneous for the following  reasons. Adam, who was emancipated from the divine circle to be king of the earth and to  bring forth God’s descendants, was not to participate in any division on Earth. But having  become a man of matter by his transgression, he had three male children among his carnal  descendants, Cain, Abel, and Seth. Abel, having come only by order of the Creator and  for a simple divine spiritual manifestation, was not to partake in material endeavor and  was to have nothing to do with the division on Earth, which was to be distributed only to  descendants issued from the material senses. This minor was also promptly removed from  this material posterity after haying fulfilled his mission according to the Creator’s will. 
Now, only three people remained: Adam, Cain, and Seth. Adam, according to the  instructions that he had received from the Eternal, divided the earth into three parts and not  four. It could not have been any other way, you might say, because there were only three  people. But my answer is that even if Adam had had 100 children, it would not have been  possible to divide the earth into more than three parts; the earth has no more than three  parts and its shape is perfectly triangular. Thus, Adam divided it into its regional contents  as follows: the West for Adam, the South for Cain, and the North for Seth. Just as there  are only three spherical circles – the sentient, the visual, and the rational – and only three  terrestrial angles, so universal creation is also divided into three parts, and the proof that  universal creation can be divided into only three parts is the fact that one cannot find what  is called the squaring of the circle or the division of the circle into four parts. 
It is through all of these observations that we reject the fourth part which the common  people accept is the division of the earth. And so, it is only possible on this earth to have  three principal nations, from which every heterogeneous and conventionally named nation 
64 
has arisen. These three nations were again represented by Noah’s three children, for whom  this earth had been divided into three equal parts – namely, Ham in the South, Shem in the  West, and Japheth in the North, on which I will elaborate elsewhere. I will add here that  the command that Adam received from the Creator to divide the earth in this manner was  very painful for him, as it reminded him of the difference between his former state of glory  and his subsequent state of reprobation. I will tell you, furthermore, that this division of the  Earth heralded the strife which has since reigned and will do so until the end of time, and  the state of war and dissension into which Adam plunged his entire posterity. Let us return  to Enoch. 
109 
From the Planetary Sign to the Birth of Enoch, and about Planetary Signs in  General 
The birth of Enoch brought great spiritual satisfaction among Seth’s descendants. His  face bore the character that he was and that of his mission, and his advent in the world was  indicated in the heavens by a planetary sign which greatly surprised Seth’s descendants  and those of Cain even more so. This sign, which made itself known through the whole of  creation, was visible especially in the South where Cain’s descendants lived. They were  rightly more alarmed than Seth’s descendants by its appearance because they understood  that it was the omen of the scourge that the Creator was going to release upon them and all  inhabitants of that southern region. The sign was a star which left its planetary circle; it had  come closer to Earth than usual and so had a different light than it received in its normal  course, so that it appeared as quite a contrast to the other stars. This different appearance  caused men to name it Lathau, which means sign of confusion and earthly trouble, and is  what is commonly called a comet. This is what the sign looked like: 

So that you understand perfectly what a planetary sign is, you need to learn that every  celestial body – be it major, superior, or inferior, and which is formed of matter – is  susceptible to six divisions. A planetary circle is composed of six principal stars of equal  stature, virtue, and power which receive their order of action, movement, and operation  from a superior star at the center of the six making up the planetary circle. In the intervals  between these stars, there are an infinite number of other bodies that we call ordinary 
65 
planetary signs, commonly called little stars. These signs follow the same order that rules  the stars of the planetary circle – that is, they are arranged in sevens. Each of these signs has  seven virtues attached to the principal stars of the planetary circle and, furthermore, each  of these signs again has seven more virtues within it, which allows them to be multiplied  by their own number of virtues – that is, 7 times 7, which makes 49, which equals 13,  which equals 4. Through this number you will come to know that the superior, major, and  inferior planetary bodies are really constituted in spiritual divine and passive corporeal life,  as is the case with all permanent bodies in the universal circle. The irrational have life and  passive instincts, and the rational have the same instinct as well as impassive spiritual life. 
110 
Planets and Spirits 
You know that every being of corporeal form is born from the three spirituous essences  of mercury, sulphur, and salt, and that the axial spirits have been put into action to cooperate  in the formation of all bodies. They have done so by inserting into the various essences a  vehicle of their fire, and it is upon this vehicle that they continually act for the maintenance  and equilibrium of all forms. This is what we call passive life to which every form is  subject, whether celestial or terrestrial. We have singled out the superior, major, and inferior  planetary bodies so that we can more easily derive knowledge of their virtues and powers.  The star in the center is the superior planetary being. It governs the major and inferior  planetary bodies and is called superior because the solar influence acts immediately on  it. The superior star then communicates what it has received to the major planetary stars  which fill its circle. The majors in tum communicate with an infinite number of little stars  joined with them and which we call signs or inferior planetary bodies, and these inferior  signs, after having received the active influence from the superior and major ones, spread  the effect with precision upon the gross earthly bodies. 
This then is a small tableau of the composition of a planetary circle and its inhabitants  which one can look upon as an infinite number, owing to the multitude of different animal  and spiritual beings, pure and simple divine spirits and minors which inhabit the planetary  circles where we find the impassive spiritual life. It would not be significant for man and  all other forms, particular or general, if the planetary circles were inhabited only by those  beings that I have just described, but they still can be inhabited by bad spirits who oppose  and combat the powers and faculties of good influential actions that the good spiritual  planetary beings are entrusted to spread throughout the world, according to the laws of  order innate in them for the support and preservation of the universe. From this has come  a proverb among men that there are bad planetary influences, and this is very true as I will  explain clearly when I detail the principles of the various celestial and terrestrial bodies,  and I outline a definite knowledge of all the virtues and powers of Saturn, the Sun, and  other planetary circles. You may perhaps doubt the conjunction that bad spirits have with 
66 
good planetary ones, and this is because of the little knowledge that you have about the  good spirits and their actions, not believing it possible that they can be interrupted in their  natural functions by bad spirits. It cannot be otherwise, as I will explain. 
111 
Demons Fight the Corporeal Forms of Men and Spirits 
You are aware of Adam’s birth in a glorious form, and of his transgression and loss of  all spiritual power. You have been sufficiently instructed in this matter, but what you do not  know is whether the demon was in a corporeal form when he tempted the first man. Since  you do not know, I will tell you that the demon was from the outset in a glorious body, or  form, and this was so because it would have been impossible for pure and simple spirits to  have tempted, seduced, or entrapped each other had they been clothed in a corporeal form.  It is not the same for simple and pure spirits as it is for corporeal man. Each man is free to  communicate with or to hide his thoughts from others; a spiritual being, however, cannot  conceive a thought without other spirits noticing this thought immediately. Everything is  in the open and is felt at the same time among spirits free of matter, and the privilege that  the pure and simple spirit has in being able to read into the spirit is because of its natural  correspondence. Nothing escapes the awareness of the spirit, while the contrary is the case  among minors enveloped in a form of apparent matter. 
I want to make you understand that every superior, major, and inferior planetary spirit,  confined in a corporeal form to act according to its law for the duration of its prescribed  existence, is subject like humans to attacks and struggles in its daily operations. But the  difference between these spirits and man is that these spirits do not succumb to the attacks  of demons. The reason is quite simple: these spirits are not susceptible to corruption or  seduction, and the forms that they inhabit are not susceptible to putrefaction. These beings  act with exactitude, according to their nature, in the various forms in which they live. Their  spiritual and corporeal reintegration is also very succinct. Man, on the other hand, strays  daily from the spiritual laws within him, and he cannot hope for his reconciliation until  after a long and difficult effort, and the reintegration of his corporeal form can take place  only by a putrefaction that is inconceivable to mortals. This putrefaction breaks down and  entirely erodes the corporeal shape of man and annihilates this miserable body, just as the  sun makes the day fade from the earth when it deprives it of its light. 
112 
The Advent of Enoch Predicts the Universal Reconciliation in Three Operations 
It was not the same for the Christ, Abel, Hely, or Enoch, for their spiritual being or for  their corporeal form. In regard to Enoch, I will tell you, moreover, that his advent into the  world predicted the coming of the universal reconciler, that the sign which appeared at his  birth predicted the one which appeared at the birth of the Christ. His example corresponds to 
67 
the three separate operations that the Christ had to perform among men for the manifestation  of divine glory, for the salvation of men, and for the condemnation of the demons. 
The first operation was for the reconciliation of Adam, the second operation was for the  reconciliation of human kind in the year 4000, and the third operation – which must occur  at the end of time – will repeat the first reconciliation of Adam by reconciling all of his  descendants with the Creator for the lowers. That will be the time that the perverse spirits  acknowledge their errors and abominations while remaining for an immemorial time in the  shadow of death, in divine privation, uttering the most horrible cries of anguish. They will  also do more important and toilsome work than they had ever done during the preceding  centuries. I shall not enter into details here of the kind of work which the perverse spirits  will have to do, nor explain the number 49 before dealing with these in another place. I  must speak to you again elsewhere about Enoch when I enter into an account of epochs,  and so I shall restrict my words to what I have told you for the moment, and pass on to an  explanation of Noah. 
V. NOAH 
113 
Noah, as a Denary Number 
Of all the apparent corporeal forms, Noah is a striking and significant example of  universal, general, and particular creation. By his denary number, he is an example of the  Creator, born as the tenth of the patriarchs. He was also the last head of the families of  Adam’s descendants before the flood, and, through his descendants, he perpetuated Adam’s  descendants, which the flood had otherwise wiped off the face of the earth. 
114 
Reasons for the Flood 
Before proceeding, I should explore the reasons that brought about the flood. The so called wise, who cannot conceive of the possibility and do not know why the Creator sent  this curse upon the earth, do not hesitate to deny the fact. They ridicule those who give it  credence and see those whom the Creator made part of this event before it happened as  imaginary figures. Without responding to their weak objections, I shall tell you that this  decree was given only for the manifestation of divine justice against the demoniacal leaders,  who had completely outraged the Creator by their ceaseless persecutions of minors. The  enormous conquests that they had made over these unfortunates had made the demoniacal  leaders so proud that they believed themselves invincible and even more powerful than  the Creator. You can easily imagine how thoughtless their pride was. All of their conquests  effectively showed their weaknesses rather than their strengths, as I will explain to you.
68 
You must not think that the earth was heavily populated at that time. They were a mere  handful, but, nevertheless, to subjugate this small number of minors, the chief of the demons  not only employed all of their powers, but also the power of those in the boundless regions.  What’s more, if the minors had made good use of their freedom, all of the insinuations and  actions of the demons would have been unable to prevail against them. All of the demons’  victories were therefore limited to having rendered powerless Cain’s and part of Seth’s  feeble descendants. Of course, this weak conquest did not enable the devil to manifest  an absolute and superior power to the Creator’s upon all those minors who allowed their  will to be conquered. What was the prize for such a victory if these conquests were not  to remain within his power, and if he could not even be assured of possessing or enjoying  them as much as he would want? It is as if he had conquered nothing. He waged great  battles, and gave himself a lot of work and cares, and yet nothing prospered and remained  under his domination. 
So those then were the devil’s victories over the minors in earliest times, and the devil’s  victories are those that he has won since and will gain in the future. The more the princes  of demons use their powers against the Creator, the more humiliated and punished they are;  the more they achieve victories over spiritual minors, the more they are tormented and are  desperate because the Creator, to their humiliation, snatches away their prey by bringing  back the minors to His divine law and not allowing any complete victory to remain with  these perverse spirits nor their legions. By immutable laws, all action, movement, and  powerful authority is given to these perverse spirits to act as they will against every emanated  spiritual being, even against every corporeal form. But in spite of their persistency, none of  their works will achieve their intended goal. 
And, what goal did the demons intend to achieve? To go beyond the limits placed upon  them, by relentlessly seducing not only the earth’s inhabitants, but also those of various  celestial bodies, and directing to them more forceful attacks than their ordinary power  would allow. They mesmerized the understanding of the minors so as to make them believe  themselves to be the only true gods of the earth and the heavens, promising to obtain for  them the same powers and faculties as those possessed by Divinity, and that, if the minors  wished to follow and recognize them as their leaders, they would soon be able to act freely  upon any being whatsoever. Furthermore, these perverse spirits went so far as to persuade  the minors that universal creation was falsely attributed to Divinity, and that the God of  which they had heard, at one time, was only one of them directing all of creation and of  even man since his appearance on Earth. 
Consequently, the emanation of the minors coming from the great prince of the South,  the leading principal chief of all material and supramaterial beings (which means the vehicle  of the central fiery axis incorporated into form), they had to recognize and blindly obey  him in everything that they were inspired to do by his inferior agents. He would then be 
69 
satisfied to see their powers with as much success as their leader’s, the great prince of the  South, who acted among them daily. A regional prince of the Western part, or major prince  of the earthly demons, said to these minors, showing them the sun, “Look at the eye of this  grand universal prince. It is the house of the one who directs everything that your sight and  imagination can perceive and understand.” 
The prince of the Northern region said in turn, showing them the lunar body, “I am  telling you, dearest allies, on behalf of the most high and powerful prince who has ever  lived and who shall forever live with you and with us, that you will have to listen to what  your master is saying to you through me: ‘Turn yourselves towards this principal house,  this house where every major spirit like me and inferior and minor spirits dwell. The glory  of our great prince manifests itself there, and therefore you will have to appeal to it to  obtain from the great prince of the universe all the necessary means and faculties to equal  your power with ours.’” 
These perverse leaders were not content with just that. They taught the poor minors  that they had found the way to communicate with the inhabitants of the two houses (which  they convinced them to be the greatest and most eminent houses) – that is, the moon,  the greatest house of the sentient or earthly circle, and the sun, the greatest house of the  heavens. They recommended them not to do any work or to carry out any operation on  these houses except when in conjunction and in perfect opposition to each other, forming  the solar and lunar eclipses, because then they would obtain from the chiefs of these houses  everything that they needed, either for themselves or for those that they brought under the  protection of their all-powerful prince. The two other regional leaders used almost the same  language, so that the unfortunate minors, seduced by all of these promises, used all their  faculties and powers that they had received from the demoniacal leaders with such zeal  and precision. These possessed men made great progress in perversion and also corrupted  Cain’s descendants and a large part of Seth’s descendants in a short time. 
115 
Lessons to Draw from the Role of the Demons during the Flood 
I make the comment here that the words of the diabolical leaders must have been very  alluring to have perverted nearly all of the inhabitants of the earth in such a short period of  time, which should warn us to be vigilant and to always keep ourselves on guard, because  there is nothing that these perverse spirits cannot invent to corrupt the minor and join him  with them. Through their perceived actions, commonly called pros and cons, or action  and reaction, they operate daily in the universe. To understand how subtle their attempts  are, you need to realize that they are constantly busy at degrading forms and corrupting  spiritual beings, always hoping to achieve their goal in one way or another. They persecute  minors as soon as they start to come into this lower world even though they cannot yet use  their physical senses.
70 
This can be plainly seen through the various movements, cries, and agitation of newborn  children. We see all of these things confirmed by the birth of the Christ, His coming into  a corporeal form, and the persecutions and suffering that He endured during His life. And  so we cannot doubt that the demons are around the corporeal form as soon as the minor  has blended into it. From this stems the practice that the patriarchs had of exorcising  their descendants by blessing them, so as to ward off the perverse spirits surrounding the  corporeal form. From this too the practice of circumcision arose, or the baptism of blood,  by which the covenant was revealed to Abraham. Lastly, the baptism of grace to the newly  converted to the Christ came from this. 
116 
The Creator Protects Fallen Man, and His Creation Is Only an Image 
You may well ask in this regard what the present world would be like if Adam had not  gained his reconciliation, but I will answer this question by only saying that the decree of  the Creator regarding the demons’ molestation is immutable. The Eternal prevented the  second operation of these bad demons, who wanted to merge the minor completely with  them, so as to oppose the justice to be exercised upon them and their followers. The Creator  therefore took the minor under his wing and, in this way, all of the demons’ attempts  against His immutable laws became useless. In this way, they were held in a yet greater  privation, and they had only one simple spiritual power left that God could not take away  from them, which allowed them to act superficially in the universe. For this reason, they  could not bring about the total destruction of what the Creator determined to be, nor could  they stop the course and duration that the Creator had set for each thing. 
 In effect, the demons could not prevent the world from being what it is after man  changed from his glorious form into the form of matter. I should say here that one should  not look upon the corporeal form as a real existing material body; it comes from the primary  spirituous essences destined by the Word of Creation to retain the various impressions as  forms to be used in universal creation. It is not possible to look upon the present corporeal  forms as real without assuming that there is matter innate in the divine Creator, an idea  repugnant to His spirituality. He is called Creator because He created all from nothing,  and because all of His creation came from His imagination, and since it derives from His  divine thinking imagination, it is called image. The same divine faculty that brought forth  everything will bring back everything to His essence and, as every form has taken this  principle, so will they dissipate and be reintegrated again into the first point of emanation;  this will be dealt with later at greater length. 
You have seen the iniquitous crime that the bad demons carried out against the minors  to turn them away from the worship of God and to chain them to the Prince of Darkness  as the only divine head. Moreover, you should know that these perverse spirits always  talked to them under the guise of spiritual beings, telling them that they would be eternal 
71 
like themselves, and that when they came to shed their corporeal forms, they would not  be any the less and always have within their power to know and feel the same as the bad  demons. But, by tempting the minors through such facades, they led them to the most  terrible abominations. 
117 
Privation and Blindness of People of the Present Age 
Nevertheless, I put to you the question if, in spite of the force of the demoniacal  persecutions against the first people, or the descendants of Cain and Seth, were there not  some righteous men who defended themselves against the insinuations of bad intellect and  who distanced themselves entirely from the abominations into which other minors fell?  You cannot deny that there were some even if there were only nine patriarchs who followed  Noah, thus completing the denary number. But if I were to ask you the same question about  men today and ask you to find a righteous one in this age, you would be very embarrassed  and, in fact, you would not find any because people, since the era of the Christ, have lost  sight of the knowledge of divine worship, as they no longer see the divine manifestations  and marvels of the Creator’s law which occurred daily among the first peoples and among  the people of Israel. 
Men of this age are easily given to doubt due to their bad habits and ignorance. It  is therefore not surprising that the demoniacal intellects today are making even greater  progress among minors than in the past. Is it not true that the more we move away from an  object, the more it disappears from our focus? Further, is it not true that if we move away  from something for which we had great attachment, it leaves our memory imperceptibly,  to the point where it is very difficult, if not impossible, to recapture it with the same taste  and ardor as in the first instance? I wish to point out to you that this is precisely what has  happened to people of our era. They have become distant from all divine knowledge, under  the guise of so-called blind faith which has made them completely lose the idea of true  faith. 
Man’s faith cannot be alive and perfect if it is not driven by a superior agent; that is, this  is so when man produces works that do not quite belong to him nor manifest the power of  faith within him. But men of the present day are not bothered with these truths; they have  abandoned the spiritual sciences in favor of the negotiations and cupidity of worldly goods,  which place such a heavy veil over their eyes as to make them nearly as blind as were  Cain’s and most of Seth’s generation.
72 
118 
Type, Symbol, Prophecy 
We know that the blindness of the first generations, as well as that into which Israel fell,  was a striking repetition of the privation of Adam during the time that the Creator exercised  His law against him. This spiritual inaction is the punishment of every spirit who strays  from the Creator, because no spiritual being in divine privation can practice divine worship  when he has not received his reconciliation through the Eternal, as is demonstrated by  Adam and several others according to their type and symbol. 
A type is a real figure from a past event, as well as an event that must occur in the future.  The symbol only provides information about the kind of event to come. A type is, at any  rate, superior to prophecy in that prophecies are only warnings for the future, and which  can be nullified by the Creator’s mercy or by a change of conduct of the people on whom  the prophecy is to fall, whereas a type heralds an inevitable event under the immutable  decree of the Creator. We should know, therefore, that this first generation, as well as the  people of Israel, were struck and horribly punished for abandoning the Creator and the  devotion for which they had been formed. 
119 
Abominations at the Time of the Christ and since His Coming 
Now I ask you what the situation the world was in when the Christ came among men.  What devotion had they rendered to the Creator? Had they not set up a market in His Temple?  Had they not recognized a God other than matter? From where had their merchandise come,  and had not this trading plunged them into idolatry? We can believe this to be the case all  the more readily since, today, we have a repeat of the same thing. They acknowledge that  to gain worldly riches, the Creator should be forgotten. These people perfectly outline  for us the past two eras, namely the generations of Adam and of Israel. We see the same  conduct, the same example, and the same habits among people today. The empire of demons  triumphs at the expense of weak minors. The minors have become so far removed from  divine devotion and so impure and defiled through their daily alliance with perverse spirits  that they must await infinitely more horrible punishment than that which fell upon the first  generations, because the present generation has clearly seen and heard about the one who  brought spiritual reconciliation and through whom the Creator manifested all of His works  before His creatures.
73 
What has this regenerative being not done? What has He not said to dispel the demoniacal  insinuations that were defiling minors? What did He not suffer to overturn the attacks that  the demons made against them? Did He not show them that what they were practicing did  not come from themselves since He had pointed out to them the entity who was causing  them to act against divine will, and the means that the bad demons were using to make them  renounce themselves and their souls? If some minors adopted the bad demons’ advice and  others rejected it, would not the difference in thought and will have demonstrated to these  men that a free and divine spiritual being existed within them, and, if it was not so, would  the bad demons have persecuted them so much? Through ignorance of all of this, minors  since the time of the Christ have repeated the same abominations of the first generations. 
They have equally denied their soul, and by so denying, they have denied Divinity,  because one cannot acknowledge the Creator without acknowledging purely spiritual  creatures. Cain’s generations had made the same error and neither acknowledged God nor  soul; the majority of Seth’s generation admitted to a soul but not to a divine Creator, nor to  the demoniacal spirit which directed them. They acknowledged the eternal universe which  Cain’s descendants not because the first father had instructed them in the principles of all  created things, by teaching them the melting of metals. By the forms that they gave them,  they understood that the universe and everything within it had taken shape and would  return to its first undifferentiated principle. 
120 
Israel, in Particular, Has Transgressed 
If we consider Israel, would we not see the same errors and crimes as amongst the  first generations? It is these people, however, who were witnesses to the manifestation of  complete justice and divine power. The Creator deployed all of His wonders for them, and  in spite of that, they fell under the bad demons’ sway and had the effrontery to renounce  the Eternal in preference to false gods. The conduct of their hapless descendants showed  the transgressions into which their fathers had fallen. The worship that they practiced  demonstrated that they were led only by false principles and by the prince of darkness.  They were slaves to the image of ceremonial law, but not to the truth of their soul and the  laws of the Creator. They were subject only to the cupidity of material goods. 
121 
Ishmael Proves Divine Mercy 
In spite of the wrong conduct of Cain, of Seth, of Israel’s descendants, and of those  who have come since the Christ, we have seen the Creator’s mercy manifest at all times.  Although His creature remains under the weight of divine justice, He does not withdraw  His goodness but, on the contrary, provides every means that He knows is necessary for  His creature’s satisfaction, whether temporal or spiritual. The example of Ishmael is one 
74 
of two which gives us the most striking proofs of this divine mercy. As the first natural  descendant of Abraham, he was the symbol of the type of Israel’s election. His leaving his  father’s house represents Israel’s shameful exit from the Temple into divine privation. His  fleeing from home into foreign lands represents the expulsion of Israel from the Creator’s  presence and its dispersion to all parts of the earth. 
According to the Scriptures, his mother Hagar had brought only bread for food and a  jug of water, and, having consumed it all in one day, she was stricken with despair to see  her son Ishmael near death from hunger and thirst. But, in her suffering, she did not forget  the Creator; nor did the Creator abandon her, for the angel of the Lord appeared to her and  said, “Woman! The plea that you have made to the Eternal to expiate your faults has been  granted. Arise, take your child and follow me.” 
After the angel had satisfied Ishmael’s hunger and thirst, he blessed them both in the  name of the Eternal and instructed them about the road that they should take to settle on the  land that the Creator had destined for them, saying to Hagar, “The Eternal shall take care of  your son; he will prosper on Earth in your presence and he shall bring forth twelve princes  on Earth, or twelve leaders of tribes.” Should not this example show us to put all our faith  in the Eternal, certain that He can never fail to make us happy? I shall not continue about  Ishmael here before explaining the types and eras which have come, and I shall finally  enter into an explanation of the great example of Noah as previously indicated.

Noah’s Type Floating on the Waters, Like the Creator 
Cain and Seth’s descendants not only pushed their abominations as far as abandoning  the Creator and His worship, but they also committed the most base fornication about which  one cannot think without shuddering. The Creator rose against these transgressions and  against the bad demons who had seduced them. He instructed Noah, his elected faithful, to  ready himself to construct an ark of cedar wood, in which would be housed evidence of the  divine justice which was about to be meted out against the earth and its inhabitants. This  construction was called an ark because it floated on water, and its bottom had the shape of  a duck’s underbelly. It had no masts, sails, or oars. These things would not have been of  any use to those enclosed in it, because, thanks to the Creator, it was navigated by the force  of water. 
When the time came for the Creator to manifest His divine law upon the earth, He sent  to His chosen, Noah, an angel who told him in what manner he should enter the ark with  his wife, children, and his children’s wives. He was also advised about the provisions that  he should make for the rational and the non-rational animals that he would have with him.  These provisions did not consist of sought-after or refined delicacies or that tasted like the  finest flour and such things. They consisted only of the simple ordinary fruits of the earth 
75 
and, moreover, more than two-thirds of the provisions remained in the ark when everyone  had left it, for Noah and his entire family had been so frightened by the terrible punishment  that they had witnessed that they could hardly think about their earthly existence. 
Indeed, Noah had seen divine justice manifest upon the general and particular within  the universal circle, and which were all in divine privation at the time. He was so struck  by this event that, at most, he could care only for the rational animals’ spiritual life and  the physical life of the non-rational ones. That is why so many provisions remained after  the flood. During the flood, Noah was being a true example of the Creator; he floated on  the waters like the Creator had done before the chaos was ordered, according to the words  of Genesis. The heavy aquatic veil that covered the earth and hid it from the face of the  Creator alludes to the supra-heavens that most philosophers call the crystalline heaven, and  which separates the Creator and His divine domain from His temporal universal creation.  The obscuring of the luminous bodies during this event alludes to the privation of the  divine spiritual light of chaotic bodies, which had not yet received the laws to act as the  Creator had wished in order to serve as adornments and agents in the universal circle of  His creation.

Three Parts of the Body and Three Operations of Universal Creation 
This privation of the chaotic bodies’ divine light is repeated daily by the conception  of a human form in a woman’s body. We divide the human body’s frame into three parts:  namely, 1, the head; 2, the trunk; and 3, the bones of the flanks. We cannot deny that  these three parts are different in their appearance and proportion, being very distinct from  each other. It is easy to separate them without causing any fracture, if only to break the  cartilaginous ligaments that keep the three parts together, so that they form a unity by their  intimate connections. However, each has its different properties, and the different faculties  allude perfectly to the three kingdoms of nature that we recognize as the animal, vegetable,  and mineral. These three kingdoms are held within the earthly form in the same way that  the three parts of the human body are held within the envelope which surrounds the form.  I have not mentioned the four limbs nor the two arms and legs, because they are only  members of the trunk and I need to deal elsewhere with their special properties. 
The three principal parts of the human body again afford me the opportunity to explain  to you the three principal actions that caused the explosion of all chaotic bodies. The first  is the descent of the minor into the general earthly corporeal form, the second is the joining  of the divine major spirit with the minor or general soul, and the third is the limit and  the extent to which the major spirit attached itself to the celestial and terrestrial general  and particular bodies, and the various faculties and properties that He gave to these.
